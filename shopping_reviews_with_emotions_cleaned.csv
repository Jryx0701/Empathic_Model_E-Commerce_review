"Nice soft tee for my husband for Father's Day.Bright, attractive graphic as displayed on site.Timely production and delivery.Thank you!",0
"The shirt arrived rather quickly after ordering it, however, the product wasn���������t really the quality or sizing expected. It was short and wide, and the printed product wasn���������t really of good quality. I don�������",4
I have purchased 3 tshirts from Teepublic and I am SO extremely happy with my purchases!Such amazing quality shirts! Better than expected. Will definetely be purchasing more and would definetely recommend to others.,1
Our order was perfect. Thank you,0
This was my first purchase with tee public and I���������m so happy with my Rainbow Bright hoodie! Fits perfectly and the design is exactly as described. Will be purchasing fro,1
"Im so disappointed in the quality for this. I knew ordering from this site was a risk but dang dude the whole sweater is garbage. Im more upset i paid 50 bucks for a sweater that looks like a grade school student made it. There is bearly any color the shadowed on the avatar, doesnt even look like freakin avatar. You can't see the arrow on his head like you can in the picture posted. There is color at the button a bit but NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE. You need to update it on the display picture because the quality you produce, looks nothing like the picture you post. This whole sweater selling point for me, was the colors. It would be chill if they were a bit faded but dude you didnt even try it seems. Just collecting money. Wont order again for this seller.",3
"Fantastic customer care. T-shirts are good quality and the print looks great. The textile smells a little bit, but nothing bad and an overnight airing on the balcony fixed it. Thank you!",0
Thank you for my awesome sghirt... Perfect for this time in our lives..,0
"Got what i ordered, the way i ordered it. No complaints here.",6
"Fun design, great quality work, and shipping was faster than anticipated. We are so happy, definitely reccomend!",1
I placed an order for t-shirts and stickers. I received the t-shirts timely and they are great. I received notice the stickers has been shipped but the tracking never has any information and I never received the stickers. Very disappointing.,3
Great customer service.I had a problem with my order and they made it right fast and easy.Thanks!!,0
XL female fit was too small. I buy XL at retailers in Canada and usually fits great. I'm disappointed I can't wear the shirt to promote my favorite podcast. :(,3
"My first purchase, the shipping was on time and the quality of the shirts are amazing!Thank you :)",0
"I love the shirts I got but, I just wish the material was more substantial.It is quite thin.I mean....I wouldn't even mind paying a bit more for better quality material.The shirts I ordered were so cute...just needed to be a bit heavier.Thanks.Hope you consider doing this.",0
"They deliver like they say they would.I ordered the wrong size and true to their word they let me exchange it for bigger with no issues or problems.I text chatted with a customer service rep and he was very nice and pleasant and had me measure one of my tee shirts at home and I gave him the measurements and he gave me the exact size I would need.I have kept my order and size so I can order again when I want something.Thank you for doing such a great job on my tee shirt, I just love it and the color.",0
"Every time I order from TeePublic, it's nothing but a smooth process. If I ever need an exchange or have a question about my order, the Customer Service is phenomenal. All the employees are very courteous, and unlike other companies that take days/weeks to respond, when you send an email to TeePublic, they respond within 24 hours, if not minutes.I now solely use TeePublic when I want long-lasting, well-made T-shirts at great value. So very grateful.",0
There was a mishap with my order and it was corrected very quickly and with such ease. I love the sweatshirts...good quality! The second one arrived today and was perfect! Thanks so much...I will definitely do business with TeePublic again!,0
I am very disappointed in the quality of the T-shirt I received. Did anyone even look at this shirt before shipping it???It is very poor quality. I am returning it and demanding a refund. I loved this shirt. If only it would have been done professionally.,3
"The hoodie was great and the design was perfect (Micheal vs Micheal, who's the real GOAT). The recipient was beyond stoked to see his gift.Thank you for making such a cool product. WILL DEFINITELY TRY TO ORDER FROM THIS SITE IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU SO MUCH",0
"Great design of tshirt. The website is easy to navigate, many sizes available. The shipping was fast. Great experience, I will buy more. Thanks!",0
"Great original shirts, thanks!",0
"While i never received my order the first time as it got lost in the mail, your prompt attention to resolve my issue was awesome.I received my replacement order in a timely fashion.Thanks",0
My husband loved his t-shirt.It has washed well.Thank you,0
"Anything I have had a problem with has been addressed promptly. I appreciate the urgency with any questions, returns, etc. Thanks guy!",0
"The items I ordered were not what I expected at all in regards to sizing.My selection was based off TeePublic's sizing chart.I understand you have a 'no return' policy.However, I did request an exception as I am a first time customer and your sizing chart is very unclear.I am extremely disappointed I have received NO response back at all.I will definitely not be ordering from your company again nor will I recommend you AT ALL!",3
Love the tshirt I ordered for my husband. It was delivered quickly and is good quality. Thanks!,0
So pleased.Just what I was looking for.Perfect.Thank you,0
"My sons love their new Piggy shirts. I think they are cut small and wish I had gotten bigger sizes, but other than that they are perfect and they arrived Before Christmas! I was worried but they came on Christmas Eve! I reached out to customer service and got an immediate response about the ETA. I was pleased. Thank you and Happy New Year!!",0
My whole order was a gift for my husband and he loved all of them! Fit is great. Printing is great. Zero complaints. Thank you!,0
Right motif on T-shirt for my grandson���������s birthday of panda eating ramen but Wrong Color! I ordered hot pink and received a very light pastel pink. Not OK,4
Underimpressed with the final product.The iron on is not very sharp.It looks cheap and small.,3
"I have bought about 20 shirts from teepublic, I'm happy with them. I bought 2 for my niece and they where smaller than I expected with the sizing, I sent an email to them about it and the next day they sent out 2 replacement shirts in a bigger size. I will buy from them again.",1
Product is great quality. Easy to order. Received quickly. Notification of when shipped was helpful. Thanks.,0

"Very quick and prompt received package quickly.Good quality exactly what I ordered. thanks,",0
"I loved the designs I chose for the face masks, but was unaware that because of the pleats in the design, some of the verbiage is unable to be read (tucks under my chin.) Also, the elastic came unsewn on one mask before I'd even worn it. I was a little disappointed.",3
Everything was perfect with my order. The hoodie came exactly when it said it would be delivered and it���������s a perfect fit.,6
The product is high quality.Very fast turn around from order.I ordered a family crest Tshirt for a gift for my grandson.I know he will be extremely happy.,1
I loved my tees. Thank you,0
"I ordered a black hoodie and I received an ugly brown hoodie instead. When I sent pictures of the product, I was told that colors inevitably fade in transit. I have never heard of that.I was then sent a dark grey sweatshirt which is still the same ugly shade of brown. Very dissatisfied.",3
Fantastic service and products. Thank you.,0

Itruly lovemy new shirt. It fits perfectly fine and it is made very well. The message on the front is perfect.iwiil definitely get more shirts from this company if they come up withmore outlander slogans. The price is very reasonable. Thank you. I am now off to find the circle of stones.,0
"My first order was flawless. However, my second order was not. My order was split into two separate shipments which was an additional charge that I didn't know about until my order was complete and I saw the price difference. Then I got my shirts and one of them was less than stellar. It looked like it had been washed several times before sent out and that was disappointing. The print wasn't clear. Overall, the shipping was fast and I got all of my items. So, I'm willing to purchase again because I like the various designs.",3
"I had a sizing problem with my order. Eliza, your representative, was extremely helpful and made my order correct.This was done so quickly that I have to give a giant Shout-Out of ""Hurray!"" for TeePublic and it's reps!!I will be doing more business with your organization.Thank-you, John Carman",0
"I had ordered a shirt to wear to a concert.When it arrived it was extremely small, and a big thread was hanging out of arm seam.I wrote Tee Public,right away I was offered a replacement.when I explained my concert was the following week they expedited my order.I had it in time, along with many compliments.thank you for your wonderful customer service!",0
"I recently had a complaint about 2 hoodies I ordered with faded print . I reached out to customer service and they helped me every step of the way to fix my problem. I was met with an email everyday by a different person from customer service , Jon , Sandy and Ingrid . Might be a couple more I���������m missing . Thank you to the whole time communicating with me swiftly and with so much compassion and empathy toward me . I will continue to purchase orders for Teepublic and support all of the great independent artist . Thanks again . Awsome way above averagecustomer service team����������",0
Awesome !! Thank you so much for all your help. Excellent communication.Thank you,0
Ordered the tshirt for my son. He loves it! Fits good & seems to be made well. Thanks!,0

I thank you, Tee Public.",0
Nice selection of t - shirts and the price is great bought 3 thanks cb,0
Fast shipping and great t-shirt design. The fitting was perfect!!! Thank you.,0
"Blotchy art on the shirt. There are white specks all over the designs. WOW. Very frustrating. The art on the website looks sharp, but the shirts look like the ink on the printer was running out.",5
"Cool shirt! It was exactly what I thought I was ordering. The process was smooth and fun too. I liked knowing some of my money went to a small business artisan, rather than all to a big megacorp.",1
We love the tee shirts and thank you!The xl woman's shirt is very small though.It fits me like a size medium would.I really would have like it to be extra large!!,0
Item arrived as described and the recipient was delighted.,1
"I ordered matching shirts for myself and my best friend who is 900 miles away. I received my shirt and my friend initially did not, which was disappointing and upsetting. When I reached out for help, I received a speedy, personal reply. The staff were able to correct the issue and my friend received her shirt within the week!",3
The shirt fit very well the material is comfortable I will order again maybe in a different color maybe something different and very happy,1

"When I received the t-shirts I was appalled at the comment on them that said ""The man who killed Don Quixote"" thinking I bought a simple ""Don Quixote"" t-shirt.....""I"" made the mistake when I checked your website but since I am a ""Don Quixote"" lover I'm disappointed....I know it's not your fault but do you know where I can get plain ""Don Quixote"" t-shirts.......?-GB",3

"Purchased 2 Monster Truck T's for Grandson, very good quality and true to size.Grandson loves them!! He's happy, so I'm happy. Very timely make, ship & delivery. 5-8 business days.",1
We love our Wings of Fire shirts that we ordered from TeePublic.The sizes were as expected and the colors and the art were just what we wanted.They also arrived in a reasonable amount of time.Thanks!,0
My experience with Teepublic was very easy and smooth the search tool was nice you can sort the items by category or key words so I was able to find exactly what I wanted. The delivery was a little late but I would put the responsibility on the delivery service not Teepublic so much. I will definitely be using the site again,6
I like the shirt. Thought the colors might have been brighter. In the add on the web page they look brighter.But I am very happy with it. Thank you,0
"I hate to leave a bad review but the quality of the shirt I received was really subpar. The cotton shirt itself is fine, but the print on there (the whole reason for ordering it) is horribly fuzzy and pixelated... basically the small thumbnail image got blown up bigger without any attempt at increasing the resolution, to the point where the lack of definition on the font almost makes it unreadable against the background image. Really disappointed by this purchase.",3
"Happy with shirts, shirts fit and feel good.",1
"Perfect and fast delivery, twice!Next order will come soon. Thanks a lot����",0
The mask was made way too small for a gown man. One extra inch of elastic would have done wonders.They barely fit my kids ears.Nice print though...Overall pretty disappointed.Jeff from Vt,3
Sadly my t-shirt was too small. I received a quick response from your customer service rep. A larger shirt is on its way to me with minimum hassle. Wonderful experience! Thanks to all!,0
Products exactly as shown and made expertly. Would definitely recommended and buy again.,6

It was what i expected the shirt would look like.It is execellent quality work and i look forward too wearing it thank you.,0
My granddaughter loves the tshirt. Thank you.,0
"The tee shirt from Bestwid titled Funny Pomeranian Cute Doge Owner Gift T-shirt was disappointing in that the colors are very faded compared to what is pictured on your website.Am not going through the process to return; it is for our granddaughter and she will probably love it.But am wondering what it will look like after a few washings.For the price, I think the product is just okay.",3
"My product was delivered in a reasonable amount of time, carefully packaged, arrive in perfect condition, and exactly as pictured/expected. Perfect transaction. Thanks!",0
"The item arrived sooner than expected, thank you.",0
The tees were as shown so that was good. Took around 2-3weeks a little over average. the actual shirt minus design quality could be better but even that wasn���������t bad. Only one print was minutely fuzzy. I bought 4 shirts I���������m being extra critical cuz all in all I���������m very happy.Honest opinion they have i,1
I never received my t shirt even though I was notified that it had been delivered.I would appreciate a full refund.,0
Very pleased with purchases. I wish the images were bigger and covered more of the shirts.I love my Speed Racer stickers. There is ink spots on my Psalms 91 shirt. Is there a way I could get another shirt? Otherwise I am pleased with my purchases. I love your 5X Shirts. Thank you for your service and products.,0
Every shirt that I purchased shrunk beyond anything I have ever seen after washing in cold water.The size charts are not true to size.I bought roughly 12 shirts as gifts and they cannot be worn as they don���������t fit.Very disappointing and will no,3
"Hi!Our order of seven t shirts went very well! Our son loved to pick out the cool graphics, and color of shirts. The quality is excellent, and customer service is always great as well. He also likes supporting artists! We definitely recommend this company. Thank you!",0

Provided Quick Delivery and Great Sweatshirts!! Thanks!!!,0
I was so happy to get my buttons just a few days after ordering! I���������ve gotten some favorable comments and I recommend that they ord,1
My grandson was very happy!,1
"I've placed three orders at TeePublic, what a big mistake!Don't trust the images of the website, what you're receiving is much different.The quality of the images transferred to sweatshirts is poor, colours are dull and transfers are not resistant to washing.I sent several e-mails to their customer service requesting refund or how to send them items back, and I still await for their reply.What you're receiving doesn't match what's shown on their website.I do not recommend this website, you will lose money, trust me!",4
Loved it thank you very much fits perfectly,0
the product was great and the service was even better thanks a lot,0
"Product was supposed to arrive with plenty of time before Christmas. Never arrived, they resent and the shirts that came although great design, both shirts said Kelly Green and they were two different colors. Highly disappointed as they look so different you cannot say they are matching.",3
Found a t-shirt with name of famous climb in the French Alps.Ordered it and it was delivered a week later.Was what I expected and delivered as promised.The recipient was very happy to receive.,1
"Usually, orders take a really long time to get them finished & on their way. This time, that was not the case! Thank you for your prompt service!",0
"I bought this hoodie for my 8 year old cousin's birthday and I am disappointed in the outcome. For one it took quite awhile to come in, the material is very thin and too expensive for the quality that I paid for... The design itself looks like it's just randomly place on the shirt. I expected awesome and good quality products, however I would never buy from this website again.",3
Great quality and fit perfect. The art not to mention it's stratospheric ;) Also the shipping was fast. Thanks!,0

Love both designs on my shirts but they came with such a strong odor to them. Not sure which shirt or if it was both but was really disappointing.,3
"I ordered a novelty t-shirt for my husband for father's day. While it didn't arrive in time (not Tee Public's fault), it was still a hit. Really soft material, fit well and the design was perfect.Thanks Tee Public!!",0

Happy New Year,0
"Sirs ��������� I wrote you 4 Nov 22.In case you did not receive it here it is briefly.All the printing on the pin cannot be seen at all.You have dark letters and something dark in the center and numbers on a dark background.I have no idea what the person was thinking who designed it because it was poorly done.I was very disappointed with it, however, since I paid for it, I will keep it, but I will not purchase in the future anything else from you because I cannot trust the designer knows what they are doing.I do not like wasting money.This was a waste.I",3

I will comeback and purchase some for me!,0
Goods are as described and arrived as organised. My expectations were met and the communication was satisfactory,6
The shirts I ordered were exactly as advertised. The sizing was accurate and they even had models for the different sizes which was very helpful. I will likely order from TeePublic again in the future.,6
"Order came fast, quality is great.Thank you !",0

To whom it may concern:I received the wrong mask. I've since submitted a service request & I'm hoping to received the correct mask. Thank you.,0
Perfect! Thank you so very much! They even arrived before Christmas!,0
"Design printing came severely flawed with portions of the print missing. If TeePublic was doing business in a store, this shirt would have never passed inspection. I contacted TeePublic with a photo for a resolution. I was offered a remake but 10 days later there is still no delivery date for this Christmas party shirt. I was very disappointed due to the cost and poor quality and customer service. I will not do business and do not recommend this business.",3
Thank you TeePublic. I made a mistakeon my order and it was fixed no problem.,0
Exactly what i ordered! Couldn't be happier! This is a Christmas gift that I know my mom will love. Thank you so much!!!,0
Well I was going to cancel my order because I hadn't received it after trying to track it from UPS to my post office and neither had my order after days of tracking I took a chance and contacted your help center to get a refund and explained my problem to Alex and he was very helpful and kind after he said he would give me a refund and also let me know he could put in a reorder and ship it through a different company if I wanted. I agreed to do that because after all it was a Christmas gift and TeePublic was the only place I found them. I now can wrap them up and put them under the tree.Thanks to Alex and TeePublic for all their help. I think Alex should get a raise for going above and beyond to help this old woman have a great Christmas. Thanks again.,0
Poor quality for the price. Print of the eagle was very poor,3
Love it! Finally found a Zuko shirt my son's size. Thank you for doing toddler sizes! My son is obsessed with Firelord Zuko but I could not find anything for a 4 yr old.,0

"Bought a tee shirt for my 6 year old grandson, he picked it out, we were looking online together and he saw this one and WANTED IT!!!No other one, just this one, an AJ Brown inspired design.A very nice product and it shipped on time and I received it in time to have it for my grandson for Christmas.Very happy to have an original designed tee shirt that's just what my grandson wanted.",1
Thank you so much. The tees fit perfectly and delivery was excellent.,0
I got my order and it was what I expected.Thank you.,0
I have ordered from here multiple times and have always been happy with my purchase. The one time I ordered the wrong size and they made it right with no questions asked. I will definitely be purchasing from them again.,1
Everything is perfect! Thank you!,0
"I purchased 4 shirts for an upcoming trip to Disney.Love the designs, but the execution and final product need some work.Depending on the shirt, mediums and larges typically fit me.The 4 that I purchased were a size large based on the sizing chart that had a picture of someone of similar size and build to me.Well, that's way off.One of the 4 shirts fit like the sizing chart indicates and all 4 fit differently and appear to be different lengths.Two of the shirts are the length of XL.Both of those also have printing issues.One has visible vertical lines across the image.The other has a very faded, almost blurry image while the picture on line shows a sharp and crisp image.So one of the shirts fits great, one is ok, and two are terrible.This purchase was disappointing to say the least.",3
"I ordered 2 Tee's. One for myself and 1 for my husband. The shipping was kinda of slow( I was aware that it would be). When the shirts arrived we both love them. Perfect in every way. The fit, the art, the material. I would not change a thing. I was kinda of wary of ordering because I have ordered from other places where the sizes are wonky. These are perfect. Thank you",0
The design of Banjo & Kazooie is amazing and spot on for a Smash Bros. setup. I love everything about this. Thank you so much.,0
"We like the hoodie and are, overall, happy with the product. I was disappointed with the transfer of the art to the material. The lack of definition is disappointing because you cannot read the text which makes up the art. Without being able to read the text, the true power and impact of the art is lost.",3
Love it! Thank you!,0
"Items arrived sooner than offered, quality of materials are great, stickers amazing too, highly recommended. Thanks for a great delivery, thanks!",0
"Very disappointed. The art work is good, however the print is significantly smaller than what was advertised, I would say by 50 percent at least. ALSO I ordered a men's medium and it's the size of an extra small, which barely fits and makes the print seem even smaller",3
My son loves his shirt! He had the biggest smile on his face all day! Thanks!,0

"Great idea to support local artists but there is a severe communication problem with this business. I ordered a couple of magnets for the fridge on a lark. Paid for the order via PayPal. No problem, everything went through and transfers done. Got a confirmed shipped with stops along the way until it was mysteriously lost. Many emails back and forth with excuses for replies and the order was repeated by TeePublic. Again with the delays and emails back and forth (12) not including replies with the same excuses. Finally I had had enough and contacted PayPal with a complaint. After all, I wanted the dumb Billie Eilish magnets before she retires. After PayPal got involved directly I had the magnets within 1 week. Many thanks to PayPal. * I have to add that the company changed the independent artist they used and like I say, I had the magnets within 1 week.*",0

I ordered a 3X to fit a little bigger on me and it came labelled as a 3X but fit the way a large would and that is 2 sizes too small. I was highly disappointed because I was really looking forward to it and it was too short and tight when it should have actually been a little bigger.,3

Though the colour and fit of the shirt was good, the print on the back was transferred as if it was faded from the get go, and there is a nick/mark in the print that didn't transfer evenly.

"Both the tee shirt and mask were a big disappointment. I will be slower to purchase and not recommend. Both items turned out to be not what was advertised. The IPA tee shirt was illegible and it was only composed of text do that is obviously a huge problem. The picture on the web site showed a mask with no pleats. No pleats. The mask that was delivered had pleats and the design, the main selling feature and read I bought that particular mask, didn���������t work at all with pleats. The graphic made no sense and was in recognizable. The biggest problem is the deception. If I had known what I was buying. If what I got was what was offered to me, then it would have been all my choice. The bait and switch was the most disappointing. From now on, if I see something cool on the site, I will doubt if that is what I���������d get. I���������l",3
Three our of the seven shirts I ordered had issues with them. One shirt had cracked printing on delivery and the other two shirts has color issues. The print was way too dark on two of the shirts that you could not even see the imagine of what the shirt had. I will definitelynot be reordering shirts with this company again. Don't even know if its worth throwing a refund claim in. Very disappointed.,3

"Quality is good. Shipment arrived as promised. However, I was extremely disappointed in the screen print color/darkness/visibility. Cost was $53 and for the inability to see what was on the sweatshirt was a let down to say the least. It was not dark enough for the color (heather gray) of sweatshirt I ordered. You can barley see that there is writing and a picture.",3
"I've ordered from TeePublic a few times before. The designs are excellent no complaints there, however the quality of the t-shirt material this year is less than desirable.The shirts I ordered were Xmas gifts and I am not comfortable giving them as a gift because of the cheap fabric.Prices remain the same but quality has gone down :(",3

Never used Tee before. Pleasantly surprised by the quick delivery to my destination. Thanks!,0
"I was very disappointed when I received the tee shirt with faded, muted colors. You could not differentiate between the 4 shades of red, which totally changed the appearance of the design. The colors were not bright and vibrant like the image on the webpage. The shirt looks like it's been washed 100 times and left out in the sun. Perhaps the printing press needed new ink. And perhaps the white tee shirt was not as heavy duty as I had hoped, resulting in a depressing, splotchy, orangey design. Not cool.",3
Excellent service and experience. I am wearing my new shirt right now and I love it!!!!!!! Thank you the awesome packaging too!,0
Really disappointed. The font is the same color as the shirt and is completely illegible.Not as advertised.,3

"I'm so disappointed.I ordered a ""Helk Pls"" shirt.The style I ordered suggested sizing up 1-2 sizes (ummm, fix your sizing??).I usually wear a men's medium, and a women's medium or large.So I ordered a womans XL t-shirt. The shirt is at least three sizes too small, AFTER sizing up twice.The text is printed so high up that it looks ridiculous.Lastly, there's a six inch heat stain on the shirt, from the purple fabric being ironed in the press.In the end, I spent $30 on a completely unwearable shirt.Even if I lose 40lbs and the XL actually fits me at 140lbs, the fabric is burned and faded.I'm so freaking sad.I was really looking forward to wearing this at PAX.",3

Do not buy! After the first wash the letter on the front almost disappeared. I suspect after five washings this will just be a gray hoodie.,4
"I appreciate you replacing my two T-shirts for a larger size. The T-shirts are very big in the shoulders and under the armpits. The lower body of the T-shirt fits better. The original white T-shirt with the cat and the Santa hat is bright white. The replacement, the white is a dingy color. It looks like the white yellowed. It did not wash out and did have an odor. I had chosen white as it made the art work pop. I had planned on wearing the white T-shirt for Christmas Day, but it didn���������t arrive until after Christmas. Bummer!It would be nice if this could be replaced. If possible, have a different vendor make it and be sure it is bright white. ",3

I like the designs and the ease of ordering, shipping, and delivery.What I would really like to see is a better quality of cotton/materials. I like aheavier cotton than what I have received thus far and am willing to pay for it. It would encourage me to buy more if I could rely on purchasing a tee shirt that would last more than a season or two.Thank you for your products and the opportunity to comment.

I was super excited when it arrived, but when I opened the package it was the wrong tee shirt. The enclosed order form had my correct order, but a ""Queen"" tee shirt had been sent instead. I hurriedly followed all the correct protocol for returns on the website, but it's been days now, and I still haven't heard a thing from the company.

Really good service not gonna lie :) youre one of the only sellers to have merch for this obscure 90s band so thank you! it also came earlier than expected so thats rad. thank you for everthing! <3,0

"Fantastic shirt, the highest quality I have seen.Thank you so much!!",0
I ordered a mug and a ladies muscle tank recently and was really pleased with the quality of both.,1
Very happy with my order! One of the shirts design was a tad crooked but not to the point of unbearable. And a very strong smell of vinegar but I think that happens when it comes to shorts! Overall happy!,1
To be honest never used the website before but the shirts were made great and arrived on time. Thank you and will use again!,0
"shirts arrived when expected, and appear to be of high quality.Have not washed them yet, to see how they wear , but I like the patterns I selected and hope to enjoy wearing them for years.thanks",0
The order process was user friendly and straightforward. We received our shirt as quickly as promised. Our only disappointment is the poorer quality of the fabric as well as the sub standard quality of the print medium.,3
"I have been so happy with every shirt and sticker and notebook I've ordered through Tee Public.I had one issue with a printing/pleating problem on a pleated mask, and they turned around and sent me new masks that were perfect- for free -and with quick turn around in the Christmas season.",1
TeePublic got in touch and ironed out any wrinkles!! Thank You!!,0
The hoodie fited just right!I was very happy with it.I will tell my friends about yourcompany.,1
Great. Thank you!!,0
I have not recieved my full order yet. Also the T-shirt was a 2x but fit like a medium at best. I had to give it to my daughter. Very disappointed in the shirt but am looking forward to getting my face mask and hope for mutch better results.,3
The design was clever and hovered on the edge of sincerity and sarcasm. The quality was first rate and I am happy with my purchase.,1
"Love the Eagles (Band) Shirt. The line at the Concert was way too long to purchase one. So, I checked the Internet & your Web Site displayed. Thank you for having them available!! Great quality & will last for years to come. I look forward to wearing it out. Love the Eagles. Best Concert I have ever attended.",0
I ordered a medium size T-shirt recently but it was too small. It was easy to find the guidelines about contacting the company for a larger size that would fit. The person who replied was very helpful and I got the right size in great time. I thank that person for his kind compassionate response to my problem.Great work,0
"Thank you. I received my shirts they were perfect fit and great quality, the hoodie is thick and cozy! Love it!",0
Easy ordering on the site and quick shipping!Quality is great!Thank you!,0
I purchased a us 30 dragstrip tshirt for my husband and he loves it.I was amazed by the amount of t shirts that are available.I will keep you on my favorites list.Thanks!!,0
Very Happy with my order. The Prints on the shirts came out PERFECT. The colorsare nice and bright. What I am beyond happy about is the size of the image on the shirt. I was hoping for them to be huge prints & they are which i am stoked about. Thanks again. Looking forward to getting some hoodies when TeePublic runs another sale.,0
"Got a t-shirt from you few weeks ago. I wore it few times and washed it and the print is still looking great so far.Huge choice of shirts, quick delivery, very good prices.I'm happy and will buy again.",1
"The overall quality of the sweatshirt was disappointing. The graphics were drawn well but the print quality and actual sweatshirt look very cheap for $40 but I was okay with it because my daughter is a huge Wings of Fire fan. Then, when I washed her white sweatshirt in cold water on delicate it came out with pink blotches.",3
"Perfect t-shirt! Love the Bella Brand Canvas. So soft. Received much more quickly than last order, so thank you so much!!",0
The item was exactly as pictured on the website. I would recommend ensuring ordering a size up from your normal size.,6
Happy with purchase! Tshirt is thin but overall good buy!,1
Wonderful top. Thanks!,0
exactly like the photodelivery was sooner than anticipatedthanks!,0
"I ordered three Tee Shirts, and am very happy with them.The quality of the printing is very good.The price was fair.It took a while for my order to get to me.But that can die attributed to slow delivery and mail.My thanks to Tee Republic for a satisfying purchase experience.",0
My tee shirt arrived quicker than expected. The design was as described. I'm very happy with the service and the results.,1
The hoodie itself is soft and warm. Fits as expected. The design is printed on a grey patch so there is a grey rectangle on the front with the design on top of it. It doesn't look as nice as I expected.,3
The T-shirt I ordered was a gift for a friend and so absolutely loved it!! So thank you for providing exactly what I saw online! Thank you!,0
"Poor quality print, shirt missing from order, no return response from customer service.I made initial inquiry last WED with no response until 2nd complaint and posting review.I will happy to update experience once all issues are resolved.*Updated*Vendor has since corrected issues with replacement of higher quality print shirt and fulfillment of original order.Thank you for making this right.",0
"Quick , efficient and exactly what I ordered!",6
"While the turnaround time from ordering to receiving was timely (I paid extra for UPS delivery), I am very disappointed in the quality of the T-shirts. Holding them in front of me, I can see through them. Cheap for what you pay.",3
I love the design been looking for years suggestion tank tops and long sleeve sweat shirt and also pull over hoodie thanks a million,0
"My girls (13&10) had on their Christmas list ""A shirt with my name on it"". I had no idea where to look without getting it custom made. I googled their names and TeePublic website came up. They loved it so much. I was very impressed with the quality and fast shipping that I ordered one for myself! Thank you for your service! ����",0
Recieved what I ordered. Thank you so much.,0
The photo of the design is deceiving. I thought it would be shiny instead it was more of a worn out or vintage look. Just disappointed after waiting almost two months to finally receive the package to have it not be what you expected is greatly disappointing,3
"Great range of product for the eclectic punter. Fabulous, prompt and professional service. Thank you",0
"Had a shirt image come off after first wash, and had followed care procedures.A replacement was issued immediately.Thank you! It was the first time I'd ever had an issue with a TP shirt image. Thanks again!",0
"I received the T-shirt today and was very disappointed.I bought a Large for my granddaughter and it is WAY too small! She's 18, 110 pounds, 5'4"", and it looks like it would fit an 8th grader!I am going to try to return it.I hope I don't have any trouble. Quality was good, and it came quickly.",3
My son is a huge mma fan and he loves his Conor McGregor shirt! Thanks for the great product and quick delivery!,0

Thank you for resolving my problem by sending me another shirt.,0
"Arrived just in time, it was perfect! Thank you!!",0
"Great packaging. That mug was NOT going to get broken in shipping. The graphic on the mug itself is a bit pixilated. Kinda disappointed. Still, very original. I haven't found a mug like it elsewhere.",3
Shipping estimate was correct and my products were delivered in time to wear to a special event.,6
"I bought two T-shirts online. Even after checking out and getting a purchase confirmation, I received repeated e-mails advising (incorrectly) to go back and get items in my cart.This kind of bot marketing, though common, is annoying and disingenuous.I have unsubscribed and will not make another purchase.There are other outlets for creative and independent artists.",5
"I���������ve ordered multiple t-shirts and I love all of them! Customer service is excellent. Email response is very quick. I���������m very happy with my purchases. Thank you, Teepub",0
Thank u. U are all awesome. Love the shirts I've purchased from ya,0
"I appreciated the exchange & I didn't have to return my first order, thank u.first order was a small size but needed a medium. Once i received the size medium which was a quick respond! The colors was not as ordered the first time, the colors was off a bit. I do like the one fabricbrand Gildan a better quality for the money. 5 stars for the image!!!! Thanks again!!!",0
Was a pleasure looking through all the wicked designs from all the artist best part is your helping each other not some big company support individuals,1
Shirts came on time and quality is excellent!! My son will enjoy his Christmas presents. Thank you,0
Poorest quality t shirt. The iron on also has brown marks around it and the t shirt itself is truly the worst quality! Truly disappointed since the photo made it look super nice,3
This sight is awesome! Finally got my shirts and they are well worth the wait! Thank you to all you artists for allowing us into your artistic brains with your concepts onto your shirts!,0
"I was very disappointed by my experience. First, the Christmas masks I ordered took 3 weeks to arrive. At one point, they were within 10 miles of me in Minnesota, then went all the way to North Carolina, before finally being delivered--too late for the purpose for which I ordered them.The masks I received were uneven in quality of construction and were poorly designed--even if fully opened by hand, the designs were unrecognizable. There was no ""nose wire"" and the masks were too small so they wouldn't fully cover nose and chin on an adult.Hate to have to say it, but I can't possibly recommend TeePublic.Addemdum: I was issued a full refund and after this review was initially written, TeePublic reached out and offered to make it right But since I wanted Christian Christmas masks FOR CHRISTMAS and its December 23rd, there's really nothing more to be done.",3
"Thank you again for the shirt, this was something I've been wanting to get and hopefully I'll come back to this site sometime soon.",0
Always happy with what I order from you folks.Delivery was so quick too.Thanks again,0
I ordered from TeePublic after having a horrible experience with BustedTees.I was so happy in TeePublics process and shipping time - they were so fast!And the shirts are great - true to size and so fun!We haven't washed them yet so we don't know how they wear.Looking forward to buying more shirts from them!,1

I got my package and everything is fine. The products are made of 100% cotton as described.I got some problems with the delivery (delivered to the wrong place) but thanks to my neighbours I got the package.,0
The print on the tshirt looks very dull and not as it shows online I'm very disappointed.,3
We were really happy with customer service! I ordered the wrong sizeand they helped make it right without any hassle. Thanks so much!,0
"Love TeePublic, not only are there a wide range of products, The website was easy to use, the pricing was great and the delivery time was amazing. I ordered from NZ and received my items less than 7days later. Quality is amazing. Thank you!",0
"The 1st tee I ordered was misprinted. The graphic was off-center (by a lot). It was easy to communicate the mistake through the website. I sent photos and a new order was created. The second one came about a week later. Much better! The t-shirt quality is great! Overall, I am happy!",1
"I got my T-shirt after a month and when I got it, the shirt was stuck together by the lettering on the front.. it was completely ruined. The T-shirt and the image on the front felt sooooo cheap. It literally just broke apart and stuck onto each other. Such a waste of $30!!!! So disappointed.",3
I received my Hoodie quickly and I like it a lot thank u so much,0
The T shirts were well crafted and high quality. The images were clean and colorful. I'm very happy with my order.,1
I purchased three shirts and one of them arrived with significant defects. It's a red shirt with a black graphic on it but parts of the graphic were white and looked like the black had either been rubbed off or not printed properly printed in the first place. There were also white and black splotches on parts of the tee shirt when it arrived. Ther other two shirts turned out fine but I am very disappointed with the quality of the third.,3
"Thank you guys so much, I absolutely love my T-shirt.I Will be shopping with you guys more often.",0
"The size chart is not accurate. I would have ordered the size I normally order when buying womens t-shirts but I went according to the size chart which made me seem like the size I picked would be fitting for me but it was not, it is way too tight and way too small the measurements are not accurate and I did not ever wash the shirt yet",4
The T-shirt looks even better in person! I know my friend is going to love it especially since Silver Surfer stuff is soooo hard to come by!! Thank you so much!,0
i love this t-shirt.it fits me very well.but there is one slight problem that the shirt thread was hanging out on the front of the shirt.i support the artist all the way for doing a great job on designing the shirt.and i contacted the customer service and they solved it for me.and i'm a very happy customer.thanks so very much!i give this a thumbs up.��������,0
Wording on shirt is the wrong color and customer service hasn��������,4
"I received three tees that were done well.However, I ordered a specific screenprint of a beloved tv mom (Phylicia Rashad) and the shipper who sent the t-shirt clearly did a screengrab of someone else's print, bc the watermark was printed on the t-shirt. To clarify, the photo on the site shows the watermark on it ""Hi Phylicia jami360""but naturally I expected that would not appear on the actual shirt.Huge disappointment. I would never wear a shirt like that.",3
I really like your designs. My latest order got lost in the mail and you took care of it with a replacement. Thanks.,0
Happy Customer! I ordered 2 tees for a family friend. Online ordering was easy and the items were shipped in a timely manner. My friend was very happy with the tshirts.,1
"hello GROUP, I received all my orders, stickers and my 2 t-shirt and long sleeve items, perfect cotton and good but a little thin I think but overall I am happy with the service and the shipping.to Recommended and I would come back bought on the siteTony.clark / swiss",1
I am so thrilled with my tshirt! It's fantastic! Thank you!,0
Great quality product.Easy to order.Shipped quickly.Thanks TeePublic!,0
Good quality t-shirt. Thank you,0
The quality of the mask itself i was good enough but the design was very small & didn't fill the space very well. You could hardly read the verse that was printed. If the design was enlarged to fit the space better it would have been perfect. I ordered 2 of them as gifts & was VERY DISAPPOINTED. Not to mention it took over 4 weeks for them to be delivered.,3
Extremely satisfied with the price and quality of the t-shirt I ordered.Will definitely order again from TeePublic!,6
"Perfect quality. Professional service. They are good, helping and real people, doing a great piece of job. Thank you a lot!",0

Item matches description 100%.Fast delivery. Quality material,6
The t-shirt was fine but the decal was not good at all,4
"I ordered two shirts and they were here amazingly fast!I love them, but they are too small.I reached out to change my sizing and re-order, but this company decided to replace the shirts I purchased with two more - at no cost to me!That's about as good as it gets!!Thanks TeePublic!",0
I really enjoy clever T shirts because they express a sense of humor or irony. The shirts I have purchased do both.,1
"Five stars didn't happen simply because my long-sleeved T has off-center print. So, the message I got the shirt for is not centered on the shirt front. Odd. Otherwise, all purchases are beautiful. I love how roomy my mask is. Thanks for wonderful stuff!",0
Disapointed with the fact that the word 'Proud' was printed upside-down or was the flag ment to be worn upside-down????,3
I ordered the wrong size in youth and they were gracious and sent me the right size. Thank you!,0
"It took so long to get the shirt shipped, 23 days. That's WAY too long. Then somehow it was shipped to the totally wrong address. I get you guys are having a hard time with Covid. But, it wasn't even sent to my state. Then it took days between back and forth with the person helping me. And, it took another week or so to ship it. Meh, annoying.",5
It took 2 months to receive my T-shirt. That was unacceptable,4
"The t-shirt was just great and on-time, efficient and as gift the person who git it was happy and very impressed on how quick in delivery. Thanks so much!",0
I have been happy with all my orders from TeePublic.I got exactly what I ordered and they arrived by expected delivery dates.,1
I liked the design overall but the ladies top was thin and rough material and the design on the shirt was fuzzy. Disappointed.,3
We were happy with the hoodie I purchased. It seemed to fit great.,1
"Very happy with all my t shirts, thank you do much!",0
I LOVE my Navy Daughter T-shirt! I put it on immediately and absolutely love it. My lost father who my best friend just last month and my heart has been heavy. Thank you for such an awesome shirt to represent the coolest man I have ever known!,0
I���������ve always orderd from you guys and love your products. This was the first time I had an issue. I will say it had nothing to do with The company itself. Shipping list track of my package and a week or so after the eta I emailed and they shipped replacement shirts immediately. Thanks I���������d always give them a 5 as I order twice a year. Hopefully this time was a fluke. I will say they were o,0
"Easy ordering, quick shipment and quality product. Will definitely purchase again.",6
"The T-shirt was exactly how pictured.I was very pleased with the material.The t-shirt is a soft jersey material, not one of those thick crunchy t-shirts.Very happy with this purchase.",1
The shirts came out perfect! Thank you!,0
The order arrived promptly but I was so disappointed with the T-shirt.The color was so off - what was supposed to be a dark red came out as a very pale coral color.Since it's an emblem of my high school I expected it to look like the real thing.,3
had problem with a shirt.Problem fixed quickly and easily.I am happy,1
"I had an issue with the shirt I ordered due to seams and my sensory issues, and they very quickly printed and shipped a replacement on a different style shirt. I did pay the difference in the retail cost of the shirt ($2) which is still far more than they had to do! Very happy with the shirt, and the customer service!",1
Thank you for your products. Shipping takes a little longer than I paid for but the product is worth the wait,0
My Tee-shirt arrived quickly and the graphics were perfect. Very happy with this purchase.,1
Great quality and print! Thanks!,0
Easy to order; great communication; product arrived in a timely manner. overall a great and very confident experience. Thank you.,0

"The items I ordered came in a timely fashion and are of good quality, I am very happy with my purchase and have ordered more items.",1
ALL IS OK THANK YOU VERY MUCH,0
"The design and printing were awesome. However, instead of choosing a ���������soft��������� Tshirt, I chose a ���������heavyweight cotton tshirt��������� because I generally like thick shirts better. What I got was a flimsy craft store shirt of very cheap quality. I was quite disappointed. The design looks great but the quality of ",3
"Very happy with all 3 tshirts I purchased. They were all exactly as pictured on the website. The shirts themselves were great material, and the delivery times were very quick! I���������m positive my family members will be very happy with their gifts!! I will definite",1
Tried to contact seller as to flaw in design on shirt. No response.Had to give as gift. Very embarrassing. Paid good money for tshirt. Disappointed. Will not use this site again.,3
"My review is mixed, because I ordered many things, which were shipped in three separate deliveries. The order was placed online on Nov 17th, which I expected would provide plenty of time for delivery to Ontario, Canada, wrapping and then re-sending to their ultimate destinations for Christmas. Multiple email confirmations said International Shipping would take 7-14 business days. 1. Yak mug. 5 stars! The Yak graphic is fun, crisp and large, and the mug is comfortable to hold. It was shipped within two days and arrived promptly, in less than 10 days.2. Yak t-shirt (to match the mug). 5 stars! Again, the graphic is of good quality and shows up well on the Vintage Green shirt. I think the graphic would be hard to see on a dark coloured t-shirt. It arrived in about 2 weeks; plenty of time to wrap with the mug and mail for Christmas (same province).3. Six face masks. 3 stars. The quality of the masks is good, with adjustable ear elastics. Quite a few loose threads hanging out of the seams; those could be trimmed, but this should have been done when they were made. The graphics seem clear, although I'm not sure how well you'll actually be able to see them when they're being worn, particularly those with words on them. Delivery - POOR. These weren't even SHIPPED for 10 days after ordering, and didn't arrive until Dec 18th, 4.5 weeks after they were ordered (23 business days - nowhere near the stated 7-14). I couldn't wait for them any longer, so I had to go ahead and mail the other gifts (to Ontario and BC), and then pay again to mail these separately. There's no way they'll make it for Christmas. Very disappointing. :-(",3
I thought I was getting a screen printed tee. A little disappointed in the iron on.,3
T-shirt looks good!Thank you!,0
"Great designs, prices, and selection!I am very happy with my purchase and I will buy from TeePublic again!",1
"I am happy with everything - the timely delivery, the quality of the shirt and the artwork - except for one thing.The artwork is off-center by one inch.In other words, the artwork is four inches from the right sleeve seam and two inches left sleeve seam.I noticed it immediately.Other than that I am happy with the product.",1
Ordering was quick and painless.The order got to me quickly as well. The quality of the print was a little bit disappointing but the designs themselves were awesome,3
Thank you ����������,0
"I am not looking for a refund or exchange (not worth the hassle), but I was a little disappointed when my shirt came and the background behind the wording was pink, rather than white; the white was what I ordered. It looked like it may have been used and washed with the red shirt bleeding onto the white portion���������changing it to pink. Needed the white to match the shirt we gave her brother a year ago from Etsy. J",3
"I ordered a hoodie with a print on it.The screen print on the hoodie looks like it will come off the first time I wash it.... the image is much smaller than expected, and it doesn't seem like its good quality.",3
"I did not expect the customs to be nearly $40 for some t-shirts so that was frustrating. Also, the print quality is average at best--,kind of disappointed.",3
"Shipping was fast, but I pay extra for that. Quality was less than anticipated. The design is very faded and poor quality. Not what was pictured.. disappointed.",3
Thank you! Next time I will order on time !,0
The tee is cool but the sizing is kinda sucky. Ordered a large and it fits more like a medium. Kinda disappointed.,3
It's great! Was able to change a mistake I made before my order shipped. Didn't know that was a thing or is TeePublic the only ones out here doing like that lol! My order is here and I'm looking spicy! Thank you and keep at it!,0
"Very helpful customer service, thank you so much!",0
My daughter is severely fangirling over Billie Eilish... had to have a tee & it is perfect!Thanks!,0
TeePublic offered the custom shirt I wanted for my spouse in a 3XL.I couldn���������t get this size anywhere else.Very happy with the design and to be supporting in,1
I ordered wrong size.Teeepublic took care to quickly replace them for me.The wrong sized shirts were given to homeless shelter.Thank you Teepublic.Great green company.,0
"I received the tshirt in a timely manner for my husband's birthday.However, on the back of the dark purple shirt were 2 areas that appeared to be bleach stains and on the front.below the logo was the word ""HITS"" in very light letters.This is clearly not on the picture that I ordered.Very disappointed.",3
"Ordered in the past from teepublic and was very happy. This time not so much. The quality of the regular shirt wasn't the same as the past. It's fairly flimsy based on this order.Also, one of the items, that I had as a sweater, the design wasn't big enough to make it look right. It seems like no matter the size ordered, the graphic size doesn't change. Pretty disappointed overall when I compare it to previous orders.",3
"Excellent service and communication throughout the entire process.Product was perfect upon arrival in Australia!!Thank you - quality outfit, quality work!!",0
"Customer service through the email chain was great but the situation with the actual screen printer for one of the shirts I ordered is too annoying to deal with.I dont think I'll order from tee public again because if something goes wrong with the order or you need an exchange your communicating with tee public not who prepares and ships your order, so if the shirt maker doesnt care to do right by you it ends there and teepublic wouldnt be able to make sure the printer definitely gets you a replacement.So they just verify you got what you wanted or your money back.The idea of waiting for now a 3rd to be done correctly is ridiculous I'd rather just have never tried to get the damb shirt in the first place.",5
"Surprised an old friend - made her day! Shirt was excellent quality, price was reasonable and the shipping efficient. Thank you.",0
"I really want to like this shirt, really I do. But there doesn't seem to be any quality control at all. As soon as I unfolded it I could see the logo on it wasn't straight.....not even close, it's like a drunk teenager made this thing. Very disappointed in the workmanship. I guess it would be ok if I stand at a 30 degree angle (yeah it's that bad) never again with this company!",3
Happy as can be with these new shirts. Thanks y�����,0
I received a new t-shirt in the mail but it had a slight gap where a seam had separated in the sleeve. I reported that to Teepublic and they promptly replaced the defective shirt. Great service! Thanks Teepublic. Luv your shirts!,0

After ordering 11 tee shirts I realized one of them came in a color I did not order. I reached out to tee public and they sent me another 2XL in the correct color. NO CHARGE! Thank You so much Tee Public,0
"Love my shirt and mug!Been showing it off to other people! They love it as well! Thought it was hilarious!I told them where to buy it if they want to buy one for themselves!Mug cake quicker than expected and shirt came right on time!Thank you for taking the time to complete my order!Unlike what the shirt reads, I would highly recommend!",0
Lack of good packaging tracking. Poor delivert. It took 19 days for delivery when the web page said 6-8 days.,3
The shirt came exactly as it appeared on the website and it���������s true ,6
"TeePublic went above and beyond in providing service and being responsive. I bought a shirt as a gift for my uncle, and he gave me the wrong zip code in the ship to address. When the shirt shipped ti the wrong city, I alerted TeePublic and they promptly shipped a second shirt to the right address. I was very impressed by this. They could have waited until the first shirt was returned, or charged me extra for the additional shipping cost, but they didn't. Class act. Thank you, TeePublic, I'll be buying more shirts from you in the future!",0
"Have no idea how I found TeePublic, but I am so glad I did.I found a baby Yoda tee I liked and ordered it.I was glad to see that they suggested ordering 2 sizes bigger for women's tees.Tee came and it's perfect and glad I followed their suggestion on sizing.Best of all is that the proceeds go to the artists who create the masterpieces instead of some big corporation.I'll be ordering more in the future.",1
"Awesome shirt! Fast shipping and great price, Will buy from again! Thank you!",0
Would of been 5 stars just would of like the order to get to me quicker. That said I'm not against ordering from this site in the future.Thanks,0

Everything arrived quick and both products were exactly like the picture! I will be ordering again!!! Thank you!,0
My son has loved all his purchases. Thank you for great service and quality products.,0
top quality. Thanks for you're fair prices.,0
"so far everything has been waaaaaay. better quality then other similar platforms...shipping is quick...very happy, it's getting addictive...will continue to collect tees and stickers from them as long as they keep up the quality...",1
Just as advertised. Prompt shipping. Happy customer!,1
"The designs are great and I appreciate the artists putting time into them. Some of the t-shirts don't have smoothly integrated picture and cloth. But other than that, thank you!!",0
"Service was great, love our tshirts! Only problem, tried to change my size on my placed order through email, unfortunately never received correspondence. My first order, hopefully I���������ll know better next order.Thank you kindly",0
I really do enjoy the final product. The quality is nice and I was even happier to see it was preshrunk cotton. If I had one critique it would maybe be on the sizes. A size chart would have been better to have to pin point a perfect size. Apart from that though everything is great and the design is amazing.,1
Exactly what I ordered. Thanks!And got it quickly.,0
"I like how this t-shirt design was offered for both men's and women's shirts. I do not like that the design was not centered on my women's shirt, and the men's shirt was sewn irregularly.",4
These shirts were purchased as a Christmas gift. Disappointed that the gray shirt looks faded and the background English rose design is not really visible.Would think twice about placing another order with your company.,3
Very happy with the shirt and the fast delivery!,1
I did not get the shirt I thought I had ordered. I also don���������t feel the quality of the impression on the shirt is as good as I anticipated. It isn't as crisp as I would have hoped. You did ship quickly and got the size and color correct so I don���������t want to be completely negative. ,3
I ordered a Harry Potter designed t shirt size medium. I received an extra large shirt about capitalism. Kinda peeved being I ordered this before Christmas and am just now receiving it today Jan 5th. It was meant to be a Christmas gift...I understand it gets busy around the holidays so it being late was acceptable...but not getting the correct item after waiting so long is pretty ridiculous.,5
Everything was just as I ordered !! Thank you !!,0
I ordered a sweater for Christmas on 12/8. It came on 12/20 and it was a plain black sweater!!! There was no design on it!!! I emailed them and they gave me my money back. Very upsetting as this was for my sons Christmas gift!,3
The design appears much darker in the image. The sweatshirt and text is much lighter in reality. I do feel disappointed with the product.The sweatshirt size is what I had hoped for.,3
My tapestry was for a friend and I was super happy with it and she loved it. I felt the price was a little Mitch but worth it once I got it. Thanks and I will for sure be shopping with you again,0
I just received the shirt today. I love the artwork and was surprised to find the material was so soft. I was afraid it might not fit after reading the reviews but I had ordered a larger size than I normally wear so no problem. It's comfortable. Thank you.,0
"Great products - I've been buying from them for years.Recently had a problem with a product I had purchased. My problem was addressed promptly, with respect and with agreat resolution .I will definitely buy from them again.Thank you for being an awesome company!",0
I always enjoy the nostalgic side of TeePublic. But I've come to also enjoy the mashups as well. Some are laugh out loud funny.,1

Not sure this is really a company issue but have had multiple USPS challenges with deliveries on orders. Thank you!,0
"The design on the front of the shirt was not sharp. Colors bled together and it was almost impossible to read. Very disappointed.One wash and the blue color started to peel away from the fabric.Very, very disappointed.Will not buy any items from this vendor again.",3
We love the shirt! Baby Godzilla on a purple shirt. Thanks for offering such great designs and a choice of shirt color.,0
This is my third year ordering TeePublic shirts for stocking stuffers.I love the selection and the shirt material is very soft.Had to learn what sizes to order.Thanks.,0
I���������ve received my shirts my boys love it thank you wish I can show pictures of how they gonna dress for their 9,0
"You can see for yourself that TeePublic has a ton of awesome shirts - but what you can't see is that their customer service is awesome. I ordered a whole bunch of shirts online and accidentally got the wrong size (my mistake, not theirs) and so I contacted them and let them know that I was slightly larger than I used to be. They quickly set up a return and sent me a new set of t-shirts - even though it was my fault!Do you want a customer for life? Because - this is how you get a customer for life. Thank you guys!",0
I would like to say thank you for your service and I also like to say thank you for sharing my last name with me,0

"I love the variety of the tee shirts, from goodies to Dr Who to Legos wow. I have 20 in my muli-generational family from grandma to grandsons.I have ordered frequently ever 6 months with wonderful gifts, useable gifts lived by all.I have a mental health provider and computer programmer in my home and I always find appropriate gifts for each individual personality.Thanks for the site.",0
"Let me start with the positives. The shirt I ordered, was the one I recieved and I love the saying on it and the color I chose. The size was correct. My only negative was there was a small stain/spot that looks like ink or grease, I'm not really sure. If the stain was on the back or maybe the side of the shirt, I wouldn't have been as upset. However, this spot is directly on the front of the shirt right below the logo. If it wasn't a Christmas present for my father, I wouldn't have cared as much, but seeing as it was supposed to be a gift, it does bother me. I don't think I can give it to him now and that is disappointing.",3
Nice shirt with Sunoco emblem on them. They look nice and they wash nice. Thank you.,0
Great shirts and quick delivery every time I order from you. Thanks ����,0
"Very satisfied with the quality, size abs design. Would definitely recommend and buy again!",6

"I absolutely love my tshirt. Perfect fit ! You are the only ones iv seen that carry curvy , v neck womans t shirts!! Thank you",0
I was happy with the selection while ordering.I am thrilled with the products I received and I know my son will be thrilled when he gets his shirts for Christmas.Thanks !!!!,0
I ordered this sweatshirt as a Christmas gift and paid extra shipping to make sure it was delivered for Christmas.I never received the item so I contacted the company via e-mail.They responded quickly and sent out another sweatshirt.I was happy with their service to correct the mistake and the sweatshirt was a hit!,1
I had to make a return and the transaction was so simple that I was amazed.Thank you for that aspect.Quality of sweatshirt and craftsmanship was impeccable. I will order again for sure.,0

Great customer service. The artwork of one of the T-shirts I ordered was printed at a noticeable slant. They immediately ordered me a new one and even let me size up when I mentioned that the shirt was a little tight on me. I didn't even have to return the defective one. Thank you TeePublic!,0
Love my nativity T-shirt. Hope to see more in the future. Thank You ����,0

"So very disappointed with a lack of response as to what happened to our second order.UPS has a label ready, but has not received merchandise and yet, you refuse to answer emails, texts, etc, as to what happened to our $100 order. The label was ready on May 28, 2020, and it is now June 11, 2020. While the masks are nice, the customer service is abysmal and there is a better chance that I will not shop here again because of it.What a shame because the artist renderings on the masks are beautiful, but I cannot trust that I will ever even see a response for our missing order, for which I have already contacted the Better Business Bureau.",3
"Fast shipping, looks and feels great and fit is TRUE TO SIZE! So happy about that! :)",1
I enjoy the comfort and exact fit. The material used in the products have been excellent. The only downside that I've experienced is that the decal on Tee shirts seem to be still too fresh and not absorbed in the fabric. Thanx Tee Public,1

Butthe reality is, it was Christmas time, and a lot of orders were coming in.I did received them just in time for Christmas, and they were overall nice tees. I think I got a lot of value shopping here, and maybe next time I order I'll be able to bump up my review 2 more stars.

"The shirts were not true to size by any manufacturer's standards. The large was smaller than a true small. The 2X was barely the size of a true large. The T-shirt material was thin and the ""art work"" was amateurish. We were totally disappointed and will not purchase anything more from your company. If friends hear of you, we will advise them to stay far away.",3
The small t shirt was more of a child's small. Unfortunate,3
The tshirt i received was too small when I requested an exchange they said they would replace it for no additional charge and to give the tshirt to a charity which I did - hospice.Thank you - who does this??,0
I have not received my items. Therefore I cannot comment.,4
Your team is fantastic! They provided me with exceptional customer service. I made a sizing error when ordering shirts for my wife. Your team reacted to my issue with a speed and genuine concern ���������to make things right��������� that I rarely ever see. Hats off to your team. Thank you and I w,0
You have a lot of great items and one of the things. I really enjoy is the timeliness of receiving my items.,1
You sent me the wrong size (sent a youth medium and I ordered a small) and after I contacted you nobody ever replied. It CLEARLY says small on the order. I think they probably ran out of small shirts in that design so tried to pass off a medium instead of doing the right thing and sending what was ordered and paid for!! I am going to tell everybody how crappy this company is!,5
The shirts are beautiful and were delivered before Christmas as promised. Thank you so much!,0
I just received the hoodie but the lettering looks really good.I'm impressed.Thank you for the instructions on how to wash to keep everything looking well.,0
I normally wear small.I ordered Medium to be safe and it is much much too small.A petite person needs an extra large?????That is wrong!,4

"Teepublic handled a problem we had with the third party not printing the shirt as advertised on the teepublic website. After two attempts of replacing the shirt over a couple of months, Teepublic offered to replace the shirt order with a different print without extra costs.

"I have ordered 2 T-Shirts from TeePublic.The first was 6 months ago and the art work was good, however the T-Shirt quality was poor.The short sleeves were extra extra small 4 inches past top of shoulder and the fabric quality was paper thin made in third world country quality.I complained and they sent a replacement T-Shirt of the same quality so I kind of gave up.I really did like the print I had originally purchased, so I decided to try again a few weeks ago and I ordered the Premium Quality T-Shirt with the same art work.I just received the order and again the art work was good, but the T-Shirt quality was dollar store clearance bin quality.I have registered my dissatisfaction again and from here I don`t know where to go.The quality of the shirts are just flat out poor, it`s a shame because the art work is good.So, I did contact the customer service department and the T-Shirt I ordered was replaced with the Heavy Cotton version of the T-Shirt.This version seems to be the better quality version to order and the sleeves are more what a man would wear than what would be appropriate for a female.I am satisfied with the customer service I have received and the heavy cotton T-Shirt is good quality.",3

Everything fo the most is ok. Where you guys are severely lacking is color choices for shirts bigger than 2x. The basic boring colors and styles that you offer are just that boring. For me is ok for my wife it's a major disappointment! So from my point of view you are just an average t shirt company,3

Perfect!! Thanks for your help and GREAT T SHIRTS:),0
The print is awesome and I love ordering from here. My issue is with the hoodie itself. For the amount I paid I was expecting a better quality hoodie. I ordered a 2x and its fit is on the small side. Also the sleeves at the wrist do not fit well and the seam is off. It's disappointing when you are spending $50 or more.,3

The t-shirt I ordered arrived with the print not only wonky but not of the correct thing. I've found trying to get in touch with TeePublic to sort it out really hard work.

"I was very excited about picking these cool designs. The tees look so so cheap! although they are inexpensive $15-$17, the materials are way cheap in design.

I also paid for expedited shipping (3- 5 day delivery) got my package 8 days later. NEVER SHOPPING HERE AGAIN",3
My issue was resolved quickly! Thank you!!your AWESOME!!,0
Product is exactlyWhat I wanted!,6
"I ordered myself a face mask along with a laptop case. The mask came first as expected, but I must say that I was very disappointed. First off, the mask itself was extremely thin, to the point where it could've been easy to tear. Now I understand that the warning did say that these masks weren't for medical usage, but I expected a little better material than what I got. Second, the printing for the mask was completely off centered. It was so bad that bits of white edging were on the mask (When it was suppose to be completely black). Thirdly, the designing in the middle was off to the right side of the mask.But I remained hopeful for my laptop case to only get the same results. Although the printing was much better, there still was some awkward white edging (Also suppose to be mostly black). The printing was a little brighter than the picture which isn't a huge deal for me. (But I can understand how people can be upset with this). Lastly, the case didn't even fit my computer. I have a 15 inch laptop, and I struggled just trying to slip the darn thing in. Once it was in, it wouldn't even zip up. So I'm left here quite disappointed with these products. As much as I love the designs here, I sadly do not see myself shopping on here anymore.",3
It was kind of hard to tell from your model which size to get. My brother wears a 2x so I ordered the 3x and by the time he washed and dried them they fit perfectly.Also it was nice that you gave the choice of weight of fabric. Thanks,0

Shirt was very nice.Was deliveredon time like they said very happy will order again with this company.,1
Things seem as advertised for the most part.The quality of the tee shirts are nice.My problem is that the logo that was ordered was horribly off-centered.Very disappointed.It is so bad I won't even be wearing it because it looks bad and like a mistake.,3
I found the quality of the material was severely lacking in that it was very thin. This material will not survive too many washings. Also I ordered a men's medium and it is more like a women's small. It is just not worth it to me to return the item. I will not be ordering from this company again,4
The designs were beautifully printed. As masks they're ineffective at snugly and completely covering my nose and chin and require constant readjustment. Therein lies my disappointment.,3
got package all is well thanks,0
"Shipped faster than I expected, great print quality and exactly as pictured. My son wants to live in his Bluey tshirt now hahaha! Thank you so much! I would definitely order from TeePublic again.",0
The quality of the shirts was good but the print job on a few that I received was not.There were areas that were the print was scratched off and another where you couldn't even see the image clearly.Unfortunately by the time I received my order it was too close to Christmas to return.,3
"I like Teepublic a lot, but I wouldn't personally sell things on it because they don't let you adjust the amount you make on your products.",4
The quality of these T-shirts are amazing excellent priced very happy with my purchase and very fast shipping thanks guys,0
"It got here before Christmas, I just wish everything else I ordered would.Thanks, very nice!",0
Order was correct and got products quickly will order again from this company,6
Designs were wonderful.High quality t shirts.Able to track our package with ease. Thank you.We will be repeat customers,0
"The artwork is amazing, however, the sizing is way off. The size chart is nowhere near the actual size. both shirts from two different vendors are much smaller than depicted. I would make an exchange but there is no way to contact the company. Very disappointed.",3
I was very happy with the help I received from TeePublic. They solved my problem and were very helpful.,1
"Very responsive customer service.Had to make a size change, and they were very prompt responding.New item was correct and here within a reasonable amount of time.",6
"The shirt was everything I asked for. Great quality. The processing and shipping is why I gave 2 stars. Took over a month to receive shipment. That is unacceptable. For that reason alone, I will not be ordering from this company.",4
I liked the T-shirts ordered but disappointed in the shirt quality and sizing.I ordered a large but worried that after the first wash they���������re going to s,3
Ordered 3 shirts for my husband and now he wants more. They were delivered before expected. Thank you.,0

My boyfriend loves his shirt. Thank you so much !! Definitely will buy from y�������,0
"Everything looks great and was here quickly, thank you",0
"You were the first (and, so far, the only) company to sell FROM merchandise.I'm sure that'll soon be fixed as soon as season 2 premieres, but for now thanks! I have the talisman shirt and it looks awesome. Got here quickly also. Don't see that much anymore.",0
"Unfortunately I'm disappointed. I ordered a mug and a shirt on 12/5/19. The first mug (only) arrived broken. I asked for a replacement and to date have not received it or the shirt.I asked for a refund and was promised only the portion for the mug. I asked for all of my refund and saw today that I will be given one. I know holiday season must be difficult but this was ordered, in my opinion, well in advance",3
Came quickly and was exactly what I ordered. Recommend buying 1 size up,6
"Nice tshirt ,thank you",0

"The shirt was printed beautifully and the service was fast and quick responding. The only down side is I had to lint roll the tshirt when it got here before I wrapped it up for. Christmas. Maybe going that little extra step for your customers would really impress them, because if I had sent this out to a different address and had to have the gift receiver have to lint roll a brand new shirt, it's not very impressive. Still though, I'll most likely purchase from you guys again, since the shirt's image printed so nicely. Thanks.",0
"Good quality face masks.Easy to put N95 filter underneath for extra protection.We are going to be wearing masks for a long time, thanks for adding some color and fun to a serious pandemic.",0
Advertising was misleading.When I purchased the premium tee shirt it was not heavier duty.Very thin tee shirt and very disappointed with the product.,3
My last purchase quality was not that great!,3
This order was filled exactly as I wanted and the hand painting jof the 1970 Mustang is going to be a real favourite with my friend.It is perfect!!Thanks so much.Sandra,0
"Another fast delivery, good quality item, Thanks!",0
I wanted to love this shirt!! The shirt material is practically see through but does feel soft. Then the print is not vibrant like the image I ordered showed and it sticks to everything. Also disappointed because there is an artist's logo in the top corner I didn't notice upon ordering. All in all pretty disapointed,3
"Great product at a fair price, well packaged and delivered in a timely way. Thank you!",0
The designs are AWESOME But the times on shipping terrible and when I receive the t-shirt the art wasn't centered on the t-shirt. They resolved it right away. But I wait to much to have something not well finish.. Thank you.,0
Good shirt . Thank You,0
I was very happy with the design and color of the shirt. But the size of the tshirt was incorrect; I received a L shirt instead of M. I���������m hoping it will still fit (bought as a gift) but disappointing the order wasn�����,3

My first experience with this company was very positive I would order from here again there were no issues.,6
I have ordered alot of shirts and paid alot of money reasonable tho. I have gotten 3 shirts that wasn't the color I ordered and the print on one of them you couldn't see what it said. My husband was disappointed but said I'll put it up for a work shirt. I have just tried this company but I hope in the near future that I don't run into this again or I won't be ordering from here again not being mean just disappointed,3

"The art is fun and unique! But, the sizes run way small. Order 2 sizes bigger than you would normally wear. Also, keep in mind the material is very soft, but also very thin. All three of the adult T-shirts I ordered fit into a little bag inside my mailbox when delivered.",1
"Placed order 6/30/2020, today is 7/20/20207:10PM central and still no news on birthday t-shirt I ordered for my grandson. Worst yet, when clicking on ""track your order"" link, there are no further updates SINCE 7/13/2020 in Reno, NV when package was transferred to destination UPS mail facility...That is ONE WEEK AGO. There seems to be no way to contact TeePublic directly. Totally disappointing.",3
The shirts I ordered were awesome. I was happy I could find our favorites in sizes large enough for me and my husband. He's a big anime fan and you have a nice variety of designs to choose from. I will definitely use this site again. You also got the items shipped fast. Thank you,0
"I was disappointed with my purchase. I expected that the design was only printed on one side, which just looks weird. But the writing in the design is so small and dark, it's practically unreadable. It seems like it could have been proportioned better.",3

"Mugs look great.Excellent order experience, quick shipping, well packaged.Thanks!",0
"I selected 3 tee shirts this time, but only changed the tee type on the 3rd selection. I assumed that the type would apply to all three selections this time. I was a little disappointed to find 2 of them with the style that I didn't want, and only the last one being the style that I wanted for all three. Maybe make this clearer for everyone when checking out.",3
"Service was okay, like just your standard service.",6
Its was beyond what I expected. Definitely not cheap material either. Thank you so much! I'm one happy lady!,0
The colors of the tee that were on the website were not the same color tones we received.The graphic was supposed to be red and white and the colors on our actual tees were orange red and creamy yelowish color. Disappointed with the color difference.,3

Thanks for your expediency in solving my issue!!",0
"We never received our order, so I���������m unable to review the product. We followed up with USPS and they insist it was delivered. But we never got it.

Great company to buy from. Had an issue and they resolved it immediately. I will buy from them again and again thank you,0
"I was impressed at the options on Tee Public and the awesome different designs. The order was made and delivered quickly. However, the quality of the Tshirt screen was not great. It was a weak print and just not as clear or sharp in quality as I had hoped.",3
I've always been into hip hop comic books and cartoon themed shirts..so with TeePublic I'm able to find the shirts I want with great prices and it's a bonus to support the artists that create this magic!!..thanks!!,0

"I live in New Zealand. I couldn't get Rick and Morty t-shirts in the range and size options as Teepublic have on offer so I did a bit of homework about Teepublic first to double check I wasn't sending my money overseas to a scam. I ended up here on Trustpilot and to be honest the reviews were pretty bad: Poor quality, bad prints, wrong sizing, late delivery, the list goes on... But I went against my better judgement and went ahead with the sale. I have my t-shirts, they are good quality, the prints are fine and don't feel any different to any other printed shirts I've bought in the past. The sizes were on target and the delivery was 14 days from order placement. I couldn't be happier and I will use them again and recommend them to others. Thank you, TeePublic. Rob.",0
The only place to go!I have purchased many shirts from TeePublic and I have even uploaded my own art for purchase on different products. I love this amazing store and vendor. Thank you for making it so easy to share and buy innovative designs.,0

"The shirt is great, but the women���������s 3x is not a 3x. It is more like a 1x. Fortunately I routinely order up one size so it is merely tight, rather than a normal, comfortable fit.

Great quality shirt! Got to my house in the time it was supposed to. Love it. Thanks!!!!,0
They don't tell you the brand names of the tshirts which is very frustrating as all the different brands and styles all fit differently. It would be a simple thing for them to do. I fortunately I bought $100 worth of tshirts that were all Bella Canvas brand which fit a size small. So I can't wear any of the shirts I bought. Frustrating,5

It may just be the specific item I bought but I was not satisfied and I will buy another shirt from somewhere else instead.",3

If ordering a child's t-shirt, you may want to order UP a size or two, just fyi.

"I absolutely love TeePublic. I can get practically any design I can imagine, made by an artist just for me. I have lived everything I've ever ordered from them. I love supporting hard working artists. It feels like a very personal experience even though it's all done online. Thanks y'all. Please keep up the great work.Merry Christmas to all!!!",0

I Only washed the T-shirt twice and the text is already fading. Extremely disappointing I will be looking into requesting a refundUPDATE originally gave one star but they contacted me as soon as I left the review. Turns out some spray that protects the print wasn't applied (or not enough at least) and they offered me a new shirt or a refund. Thought all of their products were like mine but it is abnormal for them and this is a quality operation. Great customer service I would buy from here again without any worries.,3
"I ordered 6 alike sweatshirts for an event that is coming up.They charged my credit card, processed and shipped the order WITHOUT telling me that they were using 2 different vendors for the sweatshirts...and they arrived with 4 the same color and 2 a noticeably different shade.Very disappointing. Will be sending them all back for a full refund.",3
The t-shirts came in a children's size large which was very disappointing. Needless to say the t-shirt didn't fit me at all!! The one t-shirt came in the wrong color and you couldn't read what it said. I will never order from this company again. Nor will I recommend it. Very disappointed.,3
Sizing is insanely small. Bought the shirt two sizes to big and fits like spandex. So very disappointed.,3

This was my first order and I am very happy with the service and product.I will be ordering again in the future.,1
Exactly what I ordered. Fast shipping.,6

Artist Alejandro Mogollo is a treasure.His work is simply above the rest in pop culture.I own 10 or so of his tee shirts and will continue to add more of them.His new Rita Hayworth honors this beautiful lady.Thank you Tee Public for giving this artist a platform!,0
The shirt is a Christmas present for my husband so I am not sure of the fit yet.It looks great though.The only thing I wish could have been better was info on shipping but these days you may not have had any control of that.Thank you.,0

Your size charts are WAY off.I ordered 2 Men's medium shirts and they may fit a 5 year old.And the lettering was not straight on one of the shirts.Disappointed.,3

"I received my order in pretty good time, maybe less than a week after I ordered it. However, the quality of the shirts weren���������t that great and one was so bad you couldn���������tsee the design almost at all.

"The quality of the picture on the shirt was awful. It looked like someone downloaded a picture from the internet and then tried to enlarge it (causing it to be super blurry) and then put it on a shirt. I showed it to my husband and didn't say anything other than, ""what do you think about this shirt"". His response was, ""did you make that?"" (I've never made a shirt in my life). I will never buy again from this website. Super disappointed. I contacted the seller and never heard back.",3

I washed it once and the graphic is falling apart. Washed it inside out on gentle with cold water. I���������ve bought $10 shirts that have lasted much much longer and this one is $40!

"I was really disappointed with the tee shirt I ordered. I truly expected it to be silkscreened and instead both the image and text were rubbery stick ons.You'd think in this day and age companies would go the extra mile to make a quality product.Now i will have to wash the thing inside out, and hang to dry or we all know what will happen -- the design will start buckling, cracking and falling off.Won't be ordering again.",3
"I like the design of the shirt, but I must admit that I am very disappointed that the printing on the shirt was very much below par.The most noteworthy item is that the print on the championship belts, especially the world title above ""Flair"" is not readable.The other three are slightly better, but since the world title belt is atop the others, I expected that I would be able to read the print on it.Perhaps I received a below average product; I am not sure, since my other shirt had the same issue.",3

"Shirts are much smaller/shorter than advertised. After wearing ONE time and through a standard wash/air dry, it is too small to wear. **Thanks for your reply, the shirt basically fit when I received it, after a wash it shrunk. I used the size chart.I'm sure you won't do an exchange after washing the items so your reply doesn't change my review. Thanks**",0
"I was disappointed in the graphics on my new Banana Splits shirt. It looks a small piece of artwork was enlarged for the shirt, making it look a bit blurry.",3
The 1st thing I noticed was the offensive smell the t-shirts have. I'm guessing its from the printing but I've purchased designed t-shirts at a store and they don't have this strong vinegar smell.The tee-shirt material is very cheap!Ipaid extra for what you called softer material.What you sent me is not soft.I purchased some shirts from you before and the t-shirts were much better. Perhaps you printed them on the wrong ones.I know I was charged for the higher priced ones.Two of these shirts were gifts and I don't even want to give them out as a gift.Very disappointed!,3
All went well from ordering to delivery. Thanks,0
Had issues with delivery the first time. Second time they arrived and are beautiful. Thanks to the artist and everyone involved - great shirts .,0

10/28/20 The product material was adequate but the print was mediocre. The print was faded and color of the item I purchased was not the same as the color on the website. Very disappointing. *update(11/10/20) I received a prompt response by one of the customer service reps. TeePublic immediately sent me a new product correcting all the issues and even told me I could keep the old product. My rating has changed from 2 stars to 5 for their outstanding customer service.,3
I placed multiple orders over the span of a couple of weeks and just love all of your shirt designs!I did receive a defective shirt in one of my orders.I contacted TeePublic and used the provided customer support link.I included photos as requested along with my order number.I was contacted via email the following day informing me that my shirt was being exchanged and it was being sent out.This was great customer service which I really appreciated!I am planning to purchase more shirts in the future!Thanks.,0

They gave me an additional identical shirt that had a picture of a banana ������������ on the back. Thank you. I gave that one to my nephew who is in a wheelchair. The only thing I could say bad is some of the products were a light black instead of dark black and two of the shirts were a seemed to be of a slightly less quality. Just like at a concert, you have to check the products out because the vendor gets the shirts from many different sources. The Delta brand shirts were of higher quality but for the price I have nothing to complain about. It's not like I spent 45 ",0

Thank you so much for your great service. Your company is really dedicated to the customer.I appreciated your help and support.,0
"My shirts were great. Exactly as described! My hoodie how ever was a touch disappointing. The graphics were quite bland and somewhat dull. Otherwise, great service as usual!",3
Everything thank you. My wife is gonna love the shirt,0
Great experience - thank you!,0
My son loves his new face mask and shirt! Thanks!,0
"This shirt was advertised as soft but it is definitely not. The texture is kind of scratchy. It's still wearable and looks nice so i'll keep it, but i'm disappointed.",3
"This Hoodie is so wonderful. I love it! I love the website as well. When the package arrived it had a cute note on the paper. It really brightened my day, as I was having a bad one. Thank you so much!!!",0
It is exactly what I wanted.My son-in-law ( a Cincinnati fan from childhood) will be delighted.Thank you,0

Product arrived within the 7-10 business period.I was satisfied with everything I ordered.I would order again.,6
"I have ordered from tee public several times. the last two occasions were disappointing. First, I ordered two tee's the same size and got two very different sizes. I was somewhat satisfied that i was sent the correct size in a reasonable amount of time... then I ordered 9 tee's on Thanksgiving... and received them on DECEMBER 24... after repeated calling and asking where they were. Too late to send them anywhere, too late to even get them to their intended folks who were traveling at that point. we had to wait until the weekend after christmas to get them to people. VERY DISAPPOINTING. It was a whole MONTH to get my order.RE: Samuals response- I did exactly as you said and then had to follow up with *two* different people who said exactly the same thing that they did before, that they just couldn't help that shipping took a MONTH to get to me and that they couldn't do anything. HOWEVER, all my amazon stuff got here on time, with accurate shipping, and with a LOT MORE reliability. Woot Shirt is now owned by amazon, which is your competitor, so you might want to think about less excuses on MONTH LONG SHIPPING and the responses you gave.after being told to recontact customer service and getting the runaround and then platitudes about being given the runaround (when i did not even ask to be reconnected to customer service), i deleted a star from my review because of poor customer service... which IS something that this company can control.",3
I was not very pleased with the Raptors t-shirt for my Grandson.. The Raptor did not show up very good on the shirt.. It looked faded out but my grandson loves the Toronto Raptors and he loves just dinosaurs period.!!I would be happy to give you business in thefuture if you can work on making the decal show up better.!!. Thank you for letting me give you my opinion and good luck with your business.!!. Lisa Bailey,0
"This is my second time ordering back to school shirts. This year, all of the images are blurry and the black ink is dark grey. One of the yellow shirts is pastel - not the yellow advertised. Guess I'll blame COVID?The large shirts I ordered last year were perfect, the XL shirts this year are all disappointing. I'm glad that my son doesn't care that much... They have a guarantee to fix errors, but I don't want to be bothered with returns and refunds. I gave 2 stars (instead of one) because all 8 shirts came in the same shipping bag and they're soft.",3
I am very happy with my purchase. Great quality and awesome print! Thank you!,0
I got the wrong shirt delivered.It wasn't even close to the design I chose.,3
I ordered a shirt as fun Tshirt\joke for a friend. She got it and enjoyed the shirt and it fit well. No issues with ordering or shipping.,1
Disappointed by this TV38 Movie Loft T-shirt. While the quality of the tee itself was fine. The logo on the tee is fuzzy and out of focus.,3
"My order was great, delivered on time, and items bought were awesome. Thank you",0
I ordered 2 shirts from 2 different artists and they both came quick and exactly how I wanted! Definitely will order again! Thank you!,0
Fast shipping thank all the kids have smiles,0
Highly recommend. My order was exactly as expected and delivered as scheduled. Very smooth transaction. Would definitely order again!,6
I love the sweatshirt but am a little dissappointed as (just to be safe) I ordered a 3XL NAKATOMI sweatshirt but it still did not fit me. I normally wear a 2XL quite comfortably. The sizing seems to be off.I will try to see about getting it exchanged.,3
"I ordered a sweatshirt and when it arrived I was immediately disappointed. From the website of TeePublic I was under the impression of the icons on their website that the product would have been DTG screened/printed and instead it appears to be an iron on decal. Also, the decal was not completely filled in. When I reached out to the company they only addressed the issue of, what appears to be a poorly attached decal as saying the artist was making it look ""distressed"" so even if replacing it too would not have full ink coverage in the lettering. With this ""distressing"" as they call it makes it look quite amateur. Lesson learned.",3
Super simple website with tons of choices. I purchased 14 Tee shirts and everyone was exactly as ordered.Shipping was prompt and the whole experience was seemless.Thanks!,0
"Love the creative designs that encompass almost any and everything. The trees, hoodies, and the baseball tees are all high quality and durable. Where else can you find Muppets reenacting Anton Chigrin strangling a cop in No Country for Old Men and a Free Palestine hoodie in purple on the same site. Delivery is prompt and they keep in the loop from the time you order until it's at your front door. Great company for undiscovered artists. Thank you",0
Just right!Thank you!,0
Reliable and satisfied with the items requested. Had a problem with a dual ordered in error and was quickly resolved.,6
I was very happy with my order.It was shipped quickly.,1
My tshirt is two sizes to small and the graphics are super blurry I have seen street prints better than this extremely disappointed. They asked for a picture to confirm the mistake I sent it still havent received my refund just a confirmation email that I received my product I'm getting put through the ringer now bounced all over the place im currently in the email abyss,3
This is the first time I have bought from TeePublic and will do again. Great quality shirt and prompt delivery. Would recommend anyone to buy from here. Thankyou,0
"The ladies large T's were not true to size closer to a childs large, very disappointed.",3
So many choices at great prices and high quality - thank you!,0
"This was my second time purchasing t-shirts from this website. I enjoy buying my nephews unique graphic tees depending on what character they are into as they continue to grow up. I purchased power ranger t-shirts this time around for my 4 year old nephew. He lit up once he saw his fav ranger, the red ranger, on a t-shirt. The quality is great and the fit is accurate. Buying from TeePublic is quick and easy",1
Very good service and fast shipping. Thanks,0
Love your deigns. Very cool and original! Keep it up. Thanks.,0
Everything was perfect. My son loved the shirt and the delivery was quick. Very happy.,1
I am extremely pleased with my purchase.Shipment was faster then expected and item has exceeded my expectations.I'll definitely be ordering again.Thank you!,0
"Hi. I was very happy to find the products on your site! However, the order took longer than anticipated and is coming in 2 shipments. The items that we ordered, mug, pins (and the t-shirts haven't arrived yet) had the saying It's A Johnny Thing - you wouldn't understand.The word ""understand"" is barely legible on the mug and pins...I am waiting for the t-shirts to arrive and hope I'm not disappointed in the legibility on those. We also ordered Team Johnny - Lifetime member and those were very easy to read. The shipping was quite expensive but I know that's not your fault. But for $33, I would think I would have the products in hand by now. But still waiting on the 2nd part which is the t-shirts. Thanks for asking! Angie Brohm",0
My experience online was good . My YaYoi Kusama san tee shirt arrived on time and in good condition. Customer Service was Excellent. Thank You.,0
Ordered wrong size shirts but with an email the problem was corrected and within a week received the the perfect fit. Thanks so much!! You���������ve got my five stars ,0
Design is brilliant on both t-shirts. The major disappointments is the massive shrinkage and thinness of the fabric. They can't be worn so I guess I have to make them into pillows.,3
"Wow! The quality of these t shirts is unreal! Great creativity!! Great shirt feel and fit!! Screen printing quality is outstanding!! Washed shirts several times and no fading whatsoever!! Really impressed!! Only downside was price for shipping, just remember the more you buy, the better the shipping costs. I am gonna order 4 more now! Thanks so much!",0
Delivery went to the wrong address. From purchase to delivery it took weeks before the transaction was complete.Disappointed.,3
"Out of this world quality...Shipped fast and secure. Bit really, the question is the quality of the shirt. Let me be the first to say that this shirt is ny far one of the best quality shirt I've owned in quote sometime. Can't express it enough and I love the design by the artist. Now, I'm interested in more work from them. Thanks again!. Cheers!!",0
My go-to place for graphic tees now.Got my friend hooked on this site as well. Simple site that's easy to use and so many unique designs. LOVE. Thank you.,0
"I was looking for a t-shirt for my husband with his last name and goggled his last name several websites appeared. I looked up a few and went with tee public. So glad I did. Fast delivery,great quality for the price, exactly like their pictures and a long time customer they will have for my experience with them.Thank you, Guys for a job well done",0
"Make more selections on colors. & maybe put the complete info on there. Such as color of writing ect. You all didn't help me one bit when I tried to send my shirts back cause I thought the writing was a different color than it actually was. So no, I won't be ordering anymore from here.",4
It was perfect. Thank you!,0
"I love the variety of designs offered, but was disappointed in 2 areas: the size of the adult XL is smaller than most other xl tshirts that I own, and the images are not as crisp as I expected. They look like they got blurry when enlarged and printed. I ordered 6 different shirts, and only one looked like it printed cleanly.",3
Cool shirts and fantastic customer service. Thanks!,0

"I was excited after I placed my order. I was aware that shipping would take awhile, but it took a longtime for my order to ship and for me to receive it. As soon as I received it, I opened the package, I was very disappointed. The material is made of poor quality and one of my masks had a hole in it. I did wear one of the mask and was not happy. I will no longer order from this company.",3
I was very happy to find a variety of apparel that were recreations of shirts from a couple of iconic stores my brother founded and ran throughout the 70s & 80s and I bought quite a few so that all of the members of our family would have at least one shirt with the logo that is sentimental to us all.,1
"Nice quality products that you sometimes cannot find anywhere else. Fair pricing and fast shipping. Had a little hiccup, but customer service was great. Nice to be able to support independent artists as well. Thanks Tee Public!",0

I just want to say that the artist did amazing job on the design but i am very disappointed at how cheap of a sweatshirt they used to print the design on!I was expecting a lot higher grade material for the sweater not the lousy Gildan brand.,3
Very happy with the tshirts!,1
Thanks for the refund difference on shipping,0
High quality products that can not be found elsewhere.Very happy with my purchase.,1
Just received the t shirt and $40 for this?!!!! I don't think I've ever been so disappointed. The design isn't even on the shirt completely!!!! Waste of money,3
I ordered an XL for my father and it look like a L. Shirt is too small. So bummed it was a Xmas present.,3

My shirt came with some blurry lines in the print. Still happy with it and not worth the return.,1
I paid extra shipping to receive sooner. It's been weeks still not here. Plus the shipping info the sent didn't workforever and then when it did it says incorrect into. Will not be coming back to shop which is disappointing because i love the selectionand so do all my kids.,3

Great product and arrived quickly! Thank you TeePublic!,0
"High cotton quality, soft, comfy feel, size chart accurate, graphics crisp and clear. Cheers, Thanks!",0
"My mistake was I thought the shirt said That 70s Show and not That 70s Shirt.So that's my mistake.But my two star rating is because the design is way, way too low.I'm six foot two and the bottom almost tucks in to my pants.That of course means the design starts much too far below the collar.There's a big space between the color and the start of the design.Probably just how I feel and not anyone else, but I'm pretty disappointed.It's too complicated to return it but it will be good for wearing around the house - but not out and about.",3
"I have bought several shirts from TeePublic and I am never disappointed. The design, the availability of products, the style and the originality. Returning customer for sure!",6
Quality of the tshirt and print is poor. One of my tshirts came with a hole in it.,3
Very happy! My shirt arrived promptly in perfect condition.,1
"The shirt was a gift. It came two sizes too small. I was satisfied that the soft shirt was actually soft. However, this birthday present is now going to be used as a winter shirt for her dog, instead of a cool shirt she could wear everywhere. I was disappointed.",3
The pins & t-shirts I got were excellent. Some items are gifts for friends & I can't wait for them to get these great items! Thank you!,0
its ok i guess,6

Better than what I expected. Amazing quality. Thanks!,0
Items always get positive attention and comment.,6
"The item I ordered accidentally came to me in the wrong size-a Male medium tank is HUGE lol. At first I thought it was the women's medium I had ordered was ridiculously massive (the size said medium but actual size looked to be a women's XL-I was swimming in it. So it made sense when I found out it was a men's medium lol) I emailed them about this issue and they rectified it immediately. Both times the shipping was fast andcustomer service was superb. YT sellers should switch to this website. Because Teespring takes 4 times longer to print and ship (example, I ordered something from them a week before I ordered my item from Teeplace and I am still waiting for my merch from them.) I would definitely order from this website again. Thanks!",0
I was very happy with the products I purchased; 3 hoodies & a tee. The products were good quality; the hoodies were thick & warm. The tee was long which is great for my tall guy. All arrived correctly & in a timely manner.,1

I love it I got it quick and came out very nice thank u .,0
It took a long time to receive my order because it was repeatedly sent to a nonexistent address. I corrected this multiple times and only on 4th correction did I get part 2 of my order. That's the bad. Your team stayed at it ( I had gave up) till I received my order and that is commendable. Thanks. That is why I would shop with you again.,0

"I like the art, but the quality of the printing wasn't that good. I can see the printing border from the shirt. Also, even it is a new printing, but the color looks faded and blurry already. I ordered custom shirts from other companies, and their color were much richer and printing border wasn't showing so clear. Art was good, but disappointed on the printing.",3
The shirt was awesome just not the correct size. Thank you for promptly taking care of it. Will recommend.,0

I enjoy the service and quality of your product. The only problem is shipping. I receive notification of arrival. Turns out the the item is somewhere in the system (I know it���������s out of your control) However,1
The only thing is that I did receive the shirt. I ordered a Womens plus size 3X because I know shirts shrink. Your company sent me a shirt with a 3x tag but its more like a reg large. So very disappointed that I will not be able to wear what would have been my favorite Christmas shirt. I will keep it because I'm disabled and going to go return a package is painful. I probable will make a pillow cover with It instead. Your items must be made in China. I cannot put out a good word for your company and will not use you again.,3
I was disappointed in the quality and the sizing. These shirts were more expensive than other shirts ordered from other places and the quality was not as good.I would like a refund,3

"The t-shirt I received is a huge disappointment and total waste of money.It's an XXL that is actually sized like a Medium.It's thin, cheap cotton material.It's maroon with black lettering and the lettering doesn't even show up at all.it has white graphics on it that are too small to make out unless you are right on top of the person.It's just overall a horrible design esp for the color of t-shirt that I chose.She will never wear it.",3
Was worried about ordering from FB especially close to Christmas but arrived quickly. Love it! Thanks!,0
The shirt arrived as advertised and its labeled XXL but it sure looks smaller. If indeed it is 2xl all will be good. Otherwise i wasted my money,3
"I have ordered many t-shirts from TeePublic. I usually can find a sale on designs I like and plenty of sizing choice. Also, the t-shirts are always good quality and last thru many washings.My one complaint is that while browsing around, you often have to slog thru a certain amount of crude/offensive designs. However-This being America and due to the fact that I support freedom of thought and speech, I highly recommend shopping at TeePublic. Support the artists you love/agree with and politely allow the others to express their views.",6

"The TeePublic shirts are so well made and I get a ton of compliments on them. I have bought so many for myself and family. So many different ones to pick from and I can now take my favorite classic movies and TV shows with me wherever I go!

"I made two mistakes on my first order. I ordered seven shirts. I meant to order six. I meant to order one shirt with a 2x. I emailed them and asked them if they would exchange One of the t-shirts from 1X to a 2X. And then I would return the other one since I meant to only order one. Instead of them making me return both t-shirts, they sent me a new shirt in a size 2x, and then sent me another shirt of my choice with a different design. No questions asked. No hassle. No exchange difficulties. Customer forever. I got more than my money's worth. Have gotten nothing but good press and responses about my t-shirts from the people that see me wear them. Thanks������",0

Easy to order. Huge selection. Great sizing pics for body types.One problem: pre-shrunk? Nope. My kids shirts shrank from a youth L to a 5t in one wash. So disappointed. I guess you need to buy an adult S for a skinny 11yr old?,3

"Tee Public!!!!!! I must say I am always skeptical about online purchases especially when it comes to buying items to wear. I bought T-Shirts and masks from help from the reviews on sizes. Shirts came about 2 plus weeks. These items were bought as gifts, and the giftee loved loved them and said they fit true to size. Thanks Tee Public. Will definitely shop again.",0

Honestly if the bands seen me in these shirts they would ask me to stop listening to them. So long story short, if you want to throw your money away, want shirts that may be plain black after the second wash then by all means Teepublic is the place for you!",3

Recent experience has been excellent! THANK YOU!!!,0

Took a while to receive it. But happy with the product.,1
Fast shipping and item was just as expected! Very happy teenager!,1
Just what I expected. Quick delivery. Very happy.,1
"I would have given 5 stars but I find it very difficult to navigate your page. I type in a specific name or item I'm looking for and hundreds of options come up that have nothing to do with what I'm looking for. Also the way shirts are packged in the bubble envelopes, alot of the time they place them logo on logo so when you want to see them you have to pull them apart and sometimes the logo comes off. I will continue to order i just hope in the future something can be done. Just my opinion of course.Thank you",0
"3 out of the 4 shirts were great. However, the v-neck womans tee i bought was supposed to be a two x it looks more like a medium and i will not be able to wear it,which is a shame because i was really looking forward to it.",3
"Thank you for the lovely Thanksgiving shirt!The shirt is a beautiful brown, the lettering, and the picture is what I expected.The XL was a bit snug but it should be a bit loose come race day on Thanksgiving.Liz",0
Perfect order and fast too.. thank you.,0
I paid $40 on 4 cheap masks that I could have made for half the price or less. I would not recommend getting masks from TeePublic.,4

Thank you for fixing the problem with the shirt I had ordered . You sent the right size this time and I'm very thankful. Keep up the good work !!!,0
Absolutely love the designs on Teepublic. I bought 4 t-shirts. Shout out to all the designers. You have some crazy ideas and I love it. Keep it coming. Thanks Anurag,0
While the designs are great the quality of the images on the shirts is poor. Very disappointed.,3
Very happy with t-shirt!Highly recommend!,1

Very trustworthy.I ordered standard delivery and it arrived only one day later than initially promised.I was able to track it so there was no worry about not getting it.,6
I think what your doing for artists is awesome. I actually bought a design my son made. It really gives them confidence. Thank you.,0
Not very good quality at all. The tshirt material on its own is fine. The printing process needs a lot of work.,4

Thank you guys so much .I appreciate you. Thanks for all the things I ordered. It is perfect I love it. GOD BLESS YOU. And stay safe . Don Q,0
Honestly amazing!!!!Thank you!!!,0
I like the design offered and I picked. A suggestion that would make specific items better would be to have an option to have print located or positioned higher on shirt. This would allow shirt to be worn tucked and not cover lower part of print or design. Thanks.,0
Tee shirt is good quality! It is also true to size ! I got it in a couple of days ! Thank you!,0
Great shirt. Thanks,0
Wonderful product and shipping!! Thank you!!,0

I'm very pleased with the results of the artwork by the artist which is on the front of the Heather Gray classic t-shirt I chose and stands out beautifully. There is no doubt in my mind that I will order more t-shirts in the future from TeePublic. I am definitely recommending this company for t-shirts to family and friends. Communication with TeePublic customer service representatives by way of email we're very good when I had questions or changes to my order.Thank you TeePublic and BluedarkArt.",0

"The tee is cute.I can't speak to quality as it was a gift and went directly to recipient.But the shirt was ordered on 2 June 2020 and meant for the 4th of July.It arrived on Sunday, 12 July, six weeks after the initial order/payment. There were no shipping/tracking notifications.(Even the pandemic can't be blamed for that kind of a delivery delay.)The lack of communication and the inordinate delivery time were disappointing, to say the least.Without assurances of a more timely delivery it's unlikely that I'll be ordering from TeePublic again",3

"I bought two tshirts, both 3x but different styles (one v neck, one curvy). Usually I am a 2x but the website advised to purchase a size up. The ���������curvy��������� one was way too small and the v neck was way too big. Your shirt sizes need to be consistent. I was very disappointed as I am a teacher and I bought these shirts to wear to school (with sayings on them ���������kindness matters��������� and ���������create and inspire���������). One was going to be my ���������first day of school��������� outfit and I couldn���������t wear either one. I am so disappointed as they were $40 each and I felt like that was $80 of wasted money. I will not be purchasing from tee public again.Update: Tee Public had an excellent response to this review. They handled their business very professionally and offered to resend the shirts. I am trying the a differenas covered, and they told me I could keep or donate the original ones that didn���������t fit. I am just awaiting the arrival of the second set of shirts!

"I was disappointed with my purchase. It appears as if the company uses different brands of shirts which means the cut is different and not necessarily true to size.

"I received an item with a very bad graphic print quality. So I contact the customer service that was really nice (only reason why I gave 2 stars instead of 1). They sent me a new t-shirt for free, however the t-shirt came with the same defect. Low quality print full of black points on the image. Unfortunately I did not have a good experience on my first shop with TeePublic.",3

I���������m really enjoying my new T-Shirt!Can�������,1
I made plenty of orders though TeePublic. And that right there says it all. Very happy with everything. Big Thanks,0
There was no update given on the status of order when it was shipped only when it was delivered. The description of the product would make you think the quality would be nice but it���������s mediocre. Sizing was the worse. I purchased the XL but It does not fit at all the base lift up and is way to short. So disappointed for spending $50 for a hoodie ,3
"Thanks a lot, cool artwork <3",0
I have a few World of Walt T-shirts that I got from TeePublic. And I have never been disappointed. Thanks!!!,0

Great products! Fast service!Thanks!,0
Great shirt! My brother loved it! Thanks,0
"Flawless experience. Customer support was front loaded in case of issue. Tracking and shipping notices provided, packet received quickly, and product was perfect. Printer used Next Level shirts which I prefer (over Bella Canvas which have been irregular.) Thanks!",0
This is a company that cares about customers and not just increasing their profit line. Ordered a t-shirt for my sister and was too small. They gave me an exchange for a larger size and told me to donate the first shirt. Donated it to a church group (Spread Hope Now) to someone who needed clothes.The shirt represented the new puppy named Sunshine. It will always be a reminder to her of the sunshine people can share in their lives. Thank you all,0
"Website was easy to navigate.Ordering was easy and communication and timing of delivery was great.I did expect a bit more from the quality of design from the picture on the site, but otherwise very happy with the purchase.Many thanks!",0
"I love being able to support artists by buying and wearing their art. My only issue with this platform is how expensive shipping is! Most of the time, the shipping costs just as much (if not more) than the actual product.... disappointing. But overall I like the choice of designs and will most likely buy again.",3
I was really looking forward to this shirt for my son. But unfortunately the print on the shirts looks super faded. The colors are dul and not vibrant at all. It looks like this shirt is like 3 years old !!!,3
"I found the shirts I ordered to be exactly as I seen I on the website. I also ordered my wife a medium (that���������s what she wears) they didn���������t fit.

The company was very responsive and generous. Will definitely be my first choice in having custom clothing items made! Thanks!,0
"I ordered a black The tempo is what I say it is T, paid for brushed soft cotton, what I received was the absolute thinnest low quality t shirt I���������ve every seen. You can clearly see through it just standing in low light. Print feels like it won���������t last more than 1 or two washes if the actual tee even lasts long enough to wash. Misleading info, I was expecting a soft brushed cotton, what I received is junk. I���������m waiting to hear back from customer service, sent pics of what I received, don���������t know how they���������ll choose to resolve but I paid full price for a dollar store quality tee, extremely disappointedUpdate: customer service response was good, they recommended a different material/weight & told me to donate the horrible one. I still don���������t know what new o",3
The quality of the print was not good.,4
Quick shipment and patterns were exactly as advertised.,6
Received my order. Print was nothing like I expected. It was small and washed out. Looks like it was ironed on. Disappointed.,3
"When I ordered the original T shirt I assumed I would have to go bigger. This was not the case. I asked about changing for a smaller size. This was not a problem, with a week it was replaced by the smaller size. I would recommend TEE PUBLIC to everyone I speak to. Thank you",0
"Great 1st experience! Easy to order from site, sizing was perfect, quality is better than expected! Very happy with all 3 items we purchased, will return for future t-shirts!! :)",1
"This is where I want to shop, I've been hoodwinked too many times by other sellers, the response and delivery time was on point and the product was unique and of excellent quality, thank you Tee Public",0
The t-shirts turned out great! Thank you.,0
The customer service I received was excellent but the product I received is terrible. The first one I received was so incredibly small I requested a replacement. I received a replacement but the ink was so faded it was as though the printer ran out of ink. For $25 plus taxes I would Expectbetter quality. I did not attempt another replacement. I am left disappointed.,3
The T-shirt I purchased was of extremely low quality.The printing was faded and the material is practically see-through.Very disappointed,3
A great way to represent my Army unit - Thanks,0
More ink was needed for the screen on the t-shirt so it looks very streaky. I can also see the color of the shirt through the design. Disappointed.,3
I would definitely recommend this to others. My clothes came early and they were the perfect size. I will be shopping from you guys again. Thank you for the great service.,0
The purple print was not of consistent color it is streaky in a few spots. That is not good.,4
Love the tshirts received. Thanks!,0

I want to give a huge thanks for the customer service I received for an exchange.They were very quick to respond and sent the new size promptly.I only wish we could return for refund or store credit rather than exchange only.As the exchange did not work for me either.,0

"Bag ripped a hole during transit, tee inside was invoked with a pea size opening.Luckily, TP willingly accepted my request for an pre-order.Happy Ending.",1
The note to upsize if this is your fit and this is your style most ppl upsize by one If you usually wear a size an XL go with the XXL I. This style and material and that alone saved this whole experience.I purchased 4 shirts and having to send them back would have ruined the experience. Thank for the foot note that saved it all.,0
"Got a great deal on the shirts, they showed up earlier than expected and higher quality than I expected. Thanks guys nicely done!",0
"Ordered my sister her birthday present and it never showed.. the postal service was responsible for that.. but when I contacted TeePublic and told them, they immediately shipped another shirt for me and I am so grateful for that!

"I was very disappointed with my two hoodie purchases . The quality of the hoodies was very poor , thin , not the quality I was lead to believe in the description! The banded edging around the bottom and cuffs does nothing to hold the hoodie in shape . Certainly would not recommend these to anyone !!!",3
"Needed an exchange and was willing to send the shirts back for a bigger size but the customer service rep told me to keep them and they will send the size I wanted for free. Definitely will be buying again, thank you.",0

"I ordered several tees as gifts. I made a mistake and ordered a women's sized tee for one of the gifts and when I received, I knew right away that it wasn't going to work. I contacted TeePublic and within an hour, very late on a Saturday evening, my problem was resolved and they got my new size on order and ready to ship. I received the new size and am thrilled with the speed and professionalism with which my problem was handled. It is almost impossible to find customer service like this anymore. Thank you TeePublic for the awesome customer service!",0

My nephew is in love with his T-shirt thank u so much,0
Cute graphics and super soft tees.Very happy with my purchase!,1
"Edit: the reply I got mentioned nothing about my complaint that it is focused around Xmas. Downgrading to one star. While I appreciate the pandemic restrictions, communication about my order and timeliness of my delivery was disappointing. They said ""don't worry, it will be there by Christmas"" and we are a Jewish family. Chanukkah ends on Thursday evening, 12/17, and I ordered a hoodie in hopes my child could receive it on time. This was well within the original delivery window. I am more upset about the Christonormative communication than anything else.",3
"The t-shirts I ordered did arrive as ordered and advertised.My only ""critique"" is that the shipping time seemed awfully long (almost 2 weeks).But I'm happy with the t-shirts!",1

The sizes are all wrong!! Way way too small than all the t shirts we have ever bought!!,4
Great shirt!!!! I love it and I put it on as soon as I got it. Thank you so much!!!,0
"I received one of my orders from Tee public. I had previously ordered from them before and had high expectations after my first order. But upon receiving my second order on my second visit to the site, I was very disappointed. One shirt I received was sent in youth large not an adult men's large. Another order, my hoody, was poorly manufactured. The shoulders were sewn together in a way that made it look like I had shoulder pads sewn into my hoody lol. Another problem was the delivery. The bag was damaged and looked to be cut with something. An upon opening one of my hoodies was damaged with a hole that had been cut in it. So this order was somewhat disappointing for me. Seeing as how most were Christmas gifts for other people. So im sorry to say I had to give them 2 stars this time around",3
Hoodies were well received by my family.The originality was noticed and appreciated.Thanks midcenturydave!,0
My product arrived in a timely fashion. It was a quality product and fit to the exact size. I would definitely recommend this company and look forward to shopping with them again in the future. Thanks.,0
I love the designs but don't love the tee shirts. The quality of the shirts are poor. The artists I've ordered from do not use heavy duty tees. There should be a code or some sort of rule set by the site for designers to follow. You should not be allowed to sell if you are not going to provide quality tee shirts.,4
My Grandson was really happy to get the t-shirt! It came out very nice! They sent me a picture of it. I was very pleased!,1
Exactly what I expected. Custom graphic tees at an incredible price,6
"Hello, I received my order a couple of days ago Thank you, however I just feel a few changes can be made. The first one is the quality (material) of the shirt could be thicker and secondly the print (wording) could be a little darker. Other than that I am pleased with my order. Thank you again.",0
"To whom it may concern,I acquired about your product specifically because it was both a racer blue in color, and it was from an independent merchant. However, what I received was not ""racer blue"" in color, but instead a strongly faded version of what was advertised. Saddened to say my experience as a first time customer here was not a very pleasant one. I look forward to your response.Thanks,",0
"Overall I certainly like the shirt and the design. However, the graphic faded significantly after the 1st time I washed it and the quality of the shirt itself seems a little bit cheesy for a $30 tee shirt. I would recommend that the seller considers higher quality tee shirts in the future if the price point is going to be so high. Thank you",0
I am very pleased with the shirt I bought. The size was a 3x and it fit perfect. I was impressed with the material it was soft a pleasure to wear.,1
This is the perfect gift! It came on time and in great condition. Thank you!,0
I got my package pretty quickly and the quality was amazing!! Thanks so much!,0
I appreciate the customer service you provided in notifying me that you would send larger sizes of the tshirts I ordered. It is quite a relief to know that they were sent. Thank you,0
I was disappointed in the green shirt with garish yellow Jerry print out and would like to exchange for a black but doesn���������t look I can do that.We have bought this shirt for years as presents an expected the same soft material and more muted Jerry.

"Beautiful shirts, perfect fit!Kids love them!!THANKS!",0
The designs were fine.The impression that both shirts would be from the same manufacturer...and therefore the same color...was highly misleading on the website.Extremely disappointed. Will never use Tee Publics again.,3

I bought some wonderful positive and clever message t-shirts to wear under jackets for travel.They are a delight and I look forward to wearing them.It's my way of showing a smile while wearing a facemask!,1
"The design I purchased was very cool! Love his work. I was pleased that the shirt itself was a Bella+Canvas. The print itself was not great. The print was streaky, like when an inkjet printer is running out of ink. Not enough to send it back, but a little bit disappointing.",3

Sizing runs extremely small. I bought one size bigger than I normally wear and this thing won't fit me unless I lose at least 30lbs.

"I���������m seriously happy with the designs and quality of the items I have ordered and received. My only suggestion to the makers would be to, maybe, launder the items before shipping if you use vinegar to set the transfer/design. Or at least warn customers because it can catch some off guard to open a shirt that smells like vinegar. I bought these as a gift so I have washed them so they can be ready to wear because I know my son will want to put ",1

"I gave this only 3 stars..design was GREAT but the quality of the Tee shirt itself was not. VERY thin material and will probably shrink when washed. I bought the Bizarro shirt for my grandson's birthday, he is not a child but a grown man so it is even more disappointing to have this to give him. This was first time ordering from TeePublic and I do not know at this time if I will be a repeat customer.",3

Perfect experience ordered wrong size. They immediately sent the next size up. Thank you so much.,0
The size is not true to size. I bought a man's extra large but fits like a woman's large. The material is very thin and can see right through it. The print looks nothing like it did in the picture. Very poor quality.The only reason I gave two stars is the shipping was quick. Actually should have only gave one start. Very disappointed in this purchase.,3
Awesome quality shirts. Thank you ����,0

"Abysmal Experience: My shirts were lost in the mail.I ended up receiving them 22 days after I placed the first order and was denied next day shipping request on the re-ship.I was asked for ""follow up"" feedback via email on my initial customer service experiences, which I provided with no reply.When the items arrived, one of the shirts was printed with different color font than on the website, which partially matches the shirt color and is essentially unreadable.The rest of the graphic was faded with differing colors than the website and did not pop.I've provided the required photo of the shirt along with a snip of the promised logo from the TeePublic website and asked for a reprint because I really like the shirt.It's now Friday evening and roughly 24 hours since I reached out to customer service. I've received no reply, and I doubt I will, especially through a long weekend.Meanwhile, I ordered 3 more shirts before the first order arrived.I guess that's on me.I LOVE the idea that this business supports independent artists, but the execution and customer service is lacking.If I were an artist who designed the t-shirt I received, I would be mortified.The design was stellar, but the shirt looked awful.",3
Product was professionally done and arrived well wrapped. My son loved it. Thanks,0

"Excellent service and workmanship too, looks and wonderful artwork, thank you very much!",0
"I'm sad to write this review because I was very hopeful. I originally ordered a Billie Eilish graphic sweatshirt and the graphic online looks amazing, but unfortunately, it does not translate to the product. When I received my sweatshirt the graphic did not look like the quality shown online. It is faint and not as vibrant as the graphic shown online. I let customer service know and they were extremely friendly and helpful and said they would send another one right over and to keep the original. They were the best part of this experience.When I received the new sweatshirt it still looked dull and when I compared it to the original sweatshirt I got, they have made the graphic A LOT smaller on the new sweatshirt, possibly to try and make it more vibrant? I did not make much of a difference. Overall I'm disappointed in the quality of the print and terribly bummed because online the artist had made an incredible graphic. I wish I could attach pictures to show the difference but there's not an option to do so on this forum. I'm not sure if it's the individual artists printing it or TeePublic themselves but I would advise to be cautious because it might not turn out the way you think.",3

"Ordered and received a labeled 5x, but more like a 4x really. The graphic on the shirt is ok. Overall, only mildly satisfied.",6
What they advertise online is not the product they send out. Products look great online and then what you receive is a subpar flawed version of the online representation. Do not recommend.,4

"I was very disappointed by the artwork of the ""Inverted Jenny"" t-shirt that was received. The poor quality might not have been as glaring if there were not 3 other shirts of a similar theme.When all 4 were lined up, the others had crisp details.The Inverted Jenny is so fuzzy that it appears to have been printed on a furry blanket rather than a t-shirt.It is a large design on a large shirt (4X), but unfortunately, it just looks like a cheap product.One of the other shirts has a single stamp, ""Penny Black"", but its design is sharp and clear.If you send a subsequent survey, I will give the other 3 shirts the 5 stars they earned.",3
"Helpful customer service! Finally got a shirt replacement. The first one came awful, faded colors, missing parts of the print and very noticeable print lines. The new shirt unfortunately came after Christmas but it's okay since the friend go covid so I couldn't visit. But the new shirt came and it's perfect condition! Washed it cause the usual tees smell of vinegar and ready for my friend to open cause he loves horror movies. Thank you!",0

I had her measurements and purchased based on stated sizes with intention to have a ""little room to grow"" but there's no extra in the ladies cut.The men's cut was fine.",3
Very happy with my order. Loved my t-shirt and have now placed another order for two more. VerySatisfied with my order and how quick I received it. Thank you!,0
"The items ordered took twice the time to arrive.I was sent a survey to review my products before they even arrived.They arrived today, and I was very disappointed! The quality is very poor and the image on the shirt I purchased is very faded.The worst part is TeePublicwill not take returns. They only except exchanges if the product is damaged. I will never order again, and I recommend others don't either. You'll just be disappointed. What is shown on their website is not what you'll receive.",3

I was then disappointed to see that the order was being fulfilled by a third party. I was then further disappointed that to begin shipping took several days.

Great quality and fast shipping! Love my tank top! Thank you!,0
All the shirts are excellent at half the cost as many other retailers. Thanks!!!,0
"The designs are really nice and there are loads of great artists!However, the T-shirts quality have gone downhill for several years now. I usually order several T-shirts every 2 years for the past 6 years. And the quality of the fabrics used is getting worse and worse. 2 years ago, I had already noticed how thin the shirts were, but it was still acceptable.The last order, received yesterday, is just a complete disappointment. For example: a white Tee with fabric so thin you can see through, the other Tees that should be handwashed as it's already streched with one wash in machine (gentle wash, cold!!).Like I said, great design, awesome artists, horrible fabric quality.I think this will be my last order. Let's see if Teepublic manages to make better shirts quality.",3
"Order got here faster than expected which makes me happy. I'm glad the way the shirts are printed don't look the same as in the preview. For example, I bought a hoodie and the design was overlapping the pockets in the preview.One of the designs seem like it had a small resolution, when I compare it to my other order the one on that looks much more crisp.",1

Happy to find my daughter's favorite characters on T-shirts.These long agoand far away memories have come back to life.,1
I did not get my items in time - I throughly read the shipping information. I even contacted customer service right after the order was placed.Stated that I had to have the items by the 24th - and asked was that possible.Response was they would make shipping method changes and sent me a PayPal Invoice which I paid immediately.My shirts were delivered AFTER my event - On October the 28th - 4 days after I should have received them.Disappointed is an understatement.,3

Shirt is high quality. Impressed. Artwork on shirt came out very well and it is exactly as I expected. Thank you!,0
Took much longer than expected for my order to arrive. Also the printing of one of the designs is not as nice as it appears online - the colours aren't as bold and there's a white outline which looks like a mistake was made while printing. The design looks much cleaner online. In real life it looks a little smudgy :(,3
"I found the exact T-shirt I was looking for (not available anywhere else), and it arrived quicker than I thought. Looks and fits great, and reasonably priced. Thank you!",0

The material that's used is one of my favorites, and to top it off; The custom designs are in the best quality. I'm looking forward to ordering more in the future when there is a 30% sale. I understand the extra cost to make larger shirts, so, it's good to be able to purchase them at a normal price when the sales are up. Thank you for doing these specials!",0
The sizes are way off. The women's are way too small and the men's are way too big. The colors don't match for men's and women's even though the same color was ordered. Very disappointed.,3

"TeePublic is an awesome shop. I found many designs that could not be found elsewhere. I love the appreciation for geeks and ""being different""! Pricing is reasonable and shipping was fast despite the holidays. Will definitely continue to order from here! Thanks!",0

Spent over $100 in what I hoped would be a awesome set of tshirts for my 18m old son and every one of the shirts came in looking like really poor quality silk screening /printing for the amount spent. Each image looked like copies of a copy of a copy and even after that looked like they lost color and detail after about 5 years worth of washing. I'd return them but I doubt the results of those efforts would produce better products. Better to learn the lesson and just let folks know that they won't be receiving what the website shows. Very disappointing.,3

"The quality and timeliness of the delivery were fine, and as expected. I bought two male t-shirts and one female shirt. Although I bought a size larger as suggested for the female shirt, it was still very small. Definitely should go up two sizes.",6

Good quality and fast shipping. Thanks,0
"I was really hoping to receive better quality t-shirts from this website. The price is what you pay for at a retail store but get a good quality shirt. The prints on the six shirts I bought are not of the highest quality. One of the shirts had a damaged print that looked terrible. However, their support is really good and they took care of sending a replacement in a timely manner. The print is better but I am not satisfied with it. I am really disappointed with my purchase. I will not be buying from this website in the future.",3
I love the variety of designs. My boyfriend treated me to some of your shirts and stickers and so far I'm impressed by both. It wasn't hard to navigate the website... I didn't have to triple guess on sizing. Straight forward. Thanks.,0

Overpriced and poor quality of tshirt. There is odd discoloring on the back of the shirt - poor workmanship or the printers? The shirt is all ready pilling and I just got it today - haven't even washed it yet. I'm very disappointed. This was a special birthday gift for my son.,3
"Poster is very nice! Heavy paper stock, bright printed colors. Very happy!",1
Some times takes a bit long to get things. But overall very happy with the product when it does arrive.,1
"I bought several punk cat shirts designed by ""Doodlecats"".We are using these shirts for our family portrait this year at my wife's family reunion/inlaws 60th wedding anniversary.I ordered a large amount at once and 2 follow up shirts for new family additions.Fast shipping, highest quality, awesome service and such fun designs.I love TeePublic and have ordered so many shirts for the family and myself.Thank you so much!",0
"I am happy with the product although it took a month from the time I ordered until it was delivered.The graphic images are already configured, so there must be a more efficient way to get the image on the shirt and shipped out.",1
The printing is very poor. You can see the material through the print. The Lebron prins look worn. You can barely see the Taco Tuesday letters. I am very disappointed.,3
Looks great. Relatively quick fulfillment and shipping considering the holidays and current state of things. Thanks,0
I had never heard of Tee. Stumbled up on it when looking for football tshirt for my grandson. Pleasant surprise to find. At our local sports shop items are 3-4 times higher than at Teepublic. always kept informed about shipping status. Thank you tee :),0

"Very satisfied customer! My shirt was delivered 3 days from ship date, and it fits wonderfully!! The shirt is Made in Bangladesh and is so, so soft! I ordered a womens XL, as suggested, for it to be a little loose. Thanks for being a great company to buy from..Looking forward to my next order!",0

"the product fit , correct fit and got it on time and oh yes price was right--- thank you",0
"I was a little disappointed with the time it took to get the shirt.I am much more disappointed with the quality of the work. There are dozens of either burns or bleeds on the edges of the printing. It looks like crap. I will take pictures tonight and submit them tomorrow.Also, this 2x size seems awful large for a 2x. I assume it'll shrink a bit after a couple washes, but pre-shrinking your shirts may be a good idea, to avoid confusion in the future.And $6.99 for shipping? C'mon....I love the idea behind the business, but the execution could use a little polish.",3
"The print was crooked in most of them and in the white t-shirts the print does not look of good quality, also the shipping was very expensive, the truth is that I will not buy from you again.",4

"The t-shirts and sweatshirts I ordered were great and my kids love them!The only problem I have is that the printing on one of the sweatshirts I ordered was unclear and not great visual quality. It almost looks like the graphic resolution was too low and meant only for printing on smaller items.It is difficult to read on the sweatshirt, which is a big issue.This is a big disappointment for this one item.The other items, however, are perfect.",3

"I was very disappointed with my T-shirt purchase from Teepublic.com.The construction of the shirt is horrible, i.e. material is very thin, the letters on the shirt are not solid.I ordered the black shirt and you can see the fabric coming through the lettering especially, the white letters.If this is the kind of quality you're producing for customers, I won't be returning.My cousin recommended ordering this product, but I must say I'm very DISAPPOINTED!",3
My grandson loved his Chromebook cover. Thank you.,0

"Honestly, i am very disappointed with the outcome of my order and the way the materials was presented.

Very pleased with the T Shirt.will be back,1
"I just happened upon this site, and I'm so glad I did! I was able to find a very cool shirt for my daughter for Christmas, and I know she'll love it! There are a gazillion shirts that you won't find in stores, which ups the cool factor. If I did have one thing to suggest for improvement, I'd say that the sizes run a little small. I bought what was labled a mens medium, but it's more like a mens small. Regardless, I'll definitely shop on TeePublic again!",1
"Requesting a refund as the design was incorrect/incomplete and placed crooked on the shirt. Design itself already looks cracked and faded. Shirt is also way larger than an XL. Looks more like a XXL or XXXL. It also took over 2 weeks for it to arrive to me. Very disappointed, overall.",3
While the artist used a graphic that was too small for print and sent me a shirt with terrible quailty. TeePublic took care of me after the fact with GREAT customer service. Worked with me and worked quick at it. Thank you.,0

Awesome job great t shirt very fast shipping thank you guys so much!,0
"The mask has loops that are not elasticized and this adversely affects its fit. Also, it does not have a wire inside the edge that fits over the nose so, again, it does not fit tightly. I would not recommend this mask to anyone for these reasons.",4

was a gift and I think all good but account issues - they are now saying I don't have an account or the email address when I get emails from them so that'll be frustrating when I want to place another order.,5
Wasn't really what I expected. The words and decal look faded. You can see the white on the mask like maybe it didn't get dyed good. Disappointed after spending 60.00.,3

I usually buy a large, and on the order form it was suggested to go a size larger, so that's what I did. I'm hoping I can return this shirt for a full refund. Thanks, Nancy M. Davison.",0
I ordered a free Hong Kong tee shirt which was great. But I also ordered several free Hong Kong stickers for $2.00 each and never got them. They never came so I actually ended up losing money in this purchase. Not cool!,3

I placed an order for a bunch of Asexual Pride stuff and there was an issue with the color purple on the Asexual Pride flag on a mug I ordered. It was blue instead of purple. I contacted TeePublic and sent them a photo as proof. Danielle responded and was very polite and friendly. She told me I'd receive a new travel mug ($22 Value AFTER Halloween Sale Discount) free of charge. I'm still waiting on my stickers from them but thanks to Danielle they should have a repeat customer now. :),0

Very disappointed in my order as a whole. Even though it came in sufficient time which is the only good portion of this review. Print quality (discoloration) was bad on two of my shirts and my hoodie I ordered. Ordered over $100 worth of items. Positioning and image sizing were terrible on my two shirts (crooked and small). Bad sizing on my hoodie also. I ordered all 3XLs so imagining and quality weren't redone for my size. Great chance I wont be ordering from this site again. Super disappointed. Saw so much other stuff that looked cool and wanted to purchase.,3

"Disappointed with T-shirt.I am disappointed how bad the print looks on the shirt. The image looks great on the website. The letters are red like blood (which makes totally sense considering the movie) but on the shirt it's more of an orange. And the image itself looks like it was enlarged several times to fit the shirt and you can cleary see how pixelated it is. The quality is just bad. The shirt itself, premium T-shirt, is good quality and feels very soft and nice.",3

"I originally ordered about 12 t shirts. When they arrived, some were too big and others too small. I worried that I was stuck with this expensive purchase and would have to eat the loss. After contacting TeePublic and explaining my situation, Alexandria, explained how to use the size chart . I checked it out and once again emailed her with my sizes and my measurement on a particular place on my body. She then advised me of the sizes to select and I did so. I was afraid that I would have to pay again or pay to return first selection and then new ones. I was happy to find that she told me to donate first order and would send me a new correct size ones. They came and all fit perfectly!!!My friends and I get more compliments at the casinos and we tell them that I ordered them through you.

"I ordered a 2XL woman's t-shirt. Mind you they do not have a numerical size chart but pics of women wearing the various sizes.I ordered according to the fit I wanted.The shirt I received is NOT a woman's 2XL, perhaps a junior or child 2XL.I was so looking forward to getting this shirt only to be incredibly disappointed. I should send it back but the hassle and expense are not worth it.If you are a true curvy woman do not order woman's sizes.The shirt is beautiful and the quality is good.Just poor sizing.",3

"Ordered a tee shirt with ""amazing dad"" wording exactly what we were looking for as a gift for our daughter .Had to wait a few weeks for delivery understanderbly as it was coming from America.Very disappointed on arrival as it wasnt the one I had ordered and the replacement sent detailed various ways of using the word"" Butts"" with various pictures of a certain part of the human anatomy.This was most inappropriate so we were quite shocked.I immediately contacted the company who unreservedlyapologised &offered a complete refund &said we could keep the goods sent .They informed me that the original order was of poor print quality so could not be used I said then maybe they should have informed me so I could cancel the order.The refund was immediately put back into my account so for that top marks. I would be a little wary of future orders but commend them for their quick response to my complaint .",3
"The shirt quality is a 5 star.I ordered a 2x and they do run very small, this is disappointing because I will not wear it this small.I LOVE the print!",3

If could give 0 starts I would. I received the wrong item and I contacted customer service about 8 times and I never got a response. I even contacted the designer and no luck either!

Ordered a T-shirt on December 15th and received it almost a month later--and paid $7.29 for shipping.This seems unacceptable to me and means that I won't be ordering from Tee-Public again.The product was good (what I expected) but the service was unacceptably expensive and slow.,4
The products get a 5 star my only suggestion would be to send email confirmation of the tracking # of the packages you send. I had no idea if and when my package would arrive and it was for a gift. Thanks ML,0
I order tees for my teen daughter who has a wicked sense of humor and is very creative. She loves the designs and I enjoy finding tees that really speak to her.,1
The T-shirt looks great but the contrast writing to color shirt is not right. It should be dark lettering on light shirts. Can���������t,4
Exactly as expected & fast delivery. Thank you.,0

I���������m upset because it���������s nothing like the picture. It looks like someone washed it 5 times all the coloring is faded and flushed out. Even the logos are unreadable. This was supposed to be a gift to someone and now I have to throw it away because I can���������t give it to them the,3

The tees were even better in person! Nice quality shirts and graphics. Have recommended them to everyone who comments on the shirts! Thanks!,0
Purchase and delivery was outstanding. I was disappointed that the art work on the sweatshirts was done in silk screen and not with option with a stitched design. The silk screening looks to be a little light on the ink.Would be nice if they would let you if was going to be silk screen versus sewn design emblem on the web page.,3
This tee shirt was exactly as described. The detailed descriptions of sizes and the photos of real people wearing the various sizes and styles really helped me order correctly.,6

The quality of the t-shirts has decreased drastically. My first order a few months ago both shirts were printed well. This time there's holes in both of the images on the shirts I ordered. At 25 dollars a piece I expected a quality shirt but that is not what I received.Unhappy customer.,3

"It's very easy to use the site, but commissions are super low. The annoying part is that when you upload multiple items with the same hashtags, you still have to enter them all in manually for every item. You should be able to enter hashtags and resize objects in bulk.",5

I was very glad to receive them because they were made of fine quality material. I���������m glad someone made these and I am glad I saw them on line. Very pleased,1
Shipping to Germany was totally fine.Happy with the T-shirts all good! Shopped here a couple of times and have had no issues.,1
Very happy with the product! Will buy again!,1
Pin was $2.75 with 6 bucks shipping. I thought the pin would be metal with a push on hasp and enamel painted picture. Constructed out of stamped metal with a printed picture. Good for you're bottom line. Cheap construction. Thanks for the lesson,0
"It took nearly a month to receive my shirt.It was meant to be a birthday present needless to say it was very belated.Customer service response was indifferent, and in the end they were SO kind and refunded my shipping fee.The quality of the shirt itself was disappointing, very thin. The design looks great.I will never buy from them again.",3
The design is very nice buy the mask is essentially useless.It does not fit the face properly.,4

A couple shirts seemed much smaller than the same size of others so they replaced them immediately free of charge the same day....their promise to make things right is so true!!!,6
The hoodie i bought was horribly made i paid $52 i would expect some decent quality for that price the print was horrible i would like to return it and i want all my money back thank you have a good day.,0
"The tshirts are very poor quality, the printing was substandard and very crooked. The tshirt was not really a mans size, but was a unisex, by checking the brand name, and was cut very small. Very disappointing. Was lucky to get a refund. Would not chance again.",3
"Seems like great quality and soft. Runs just a little small though. But thanks, reminds me of the fun we had at universal",0

"Not as bright as expected.Sizes run small. Yes, computer color presentations vary, but I was disappointed that the printing on the shirt was not as vibrant as seen online.",3
I don���������t like my sweatshirt the message is too dark you can���,4
"The t-shirts were 1.5 sizes smaller. I ordered large and it felt like a med-small. Sizing was disappointing. Although the site had popups mentioning customers ""prefer to order a size up"", they should just say the tops run small. Those statements are two very different things. Sometimes customer reviews are biased and not all customers are right.In regard to artwork and quality. The art was great! The ink & print was exceptional. After first wash, the shirt was very soft. Although I prefer thick cotton t-shirts, these felt great. It was medium-light weight, although not see through & the cut was very nice and flattering.Service is 5 stars!The 4 stars was for overall service & experience, sizing is 1 star imho, they should at least post measurements for reference.",3
Awesome shirt! Thank you for quick service!,0
The shirts were promised by Christmas. They did arrive Christmas day but after 8pm so they were late for our Christmas celebration. The shirt quality was only fair so I didn't get good value.,3

"I ordered a t-shirt and I am so disappointed. They said to size up one size. They should have been more specific. I am 5'5 and 115lbs, I wear a size x-small in t-shirts.So I ordered a large.

"I was grateful to be able to exchange for another size, very helpful and kind.I would recommend to all my friends.",0
"Extremely disappointed in the sizing. I ordered an XL for a friend who wears an L because it was recommended to order up a size.Obviously this is not an adult sized tshirt, it even had a tag on the outside marking it a 12-13 which is teen sized, even if the tag inside said XL.So I didn't have a gift and was out the money. Would never order form hear again,",3
Great customer service. Great product. Thank you.,0

I received my order. My husband loves his tee shirt. Thank you so much,0
Very poor quality printing and T-shirt. Neglected to put gift message in package for recipient as well.,3
I ordered two Dr. Who shirts for Christmas. I was late ordering them and did not expect them to arrive until after Christmas. They arrived December 24! The quality is excellent and everyone is happy! Thank you so much!,0
Love the feel of the tee shirt and the design. Thanks,0
Every order I have ever placed with Teepublic had been outstanding! Always great products and communication from there team. Will continue to shop for products which. I can't find anywhere else. Also fantastic quality on all items. Most of my Christmas shopping is done through them. Thank you guys. Keep up the great work.,0
I really like the quality of the tshirts. The design is not stiff as so many tshirts and the Cotton is soft. They are just as I hoped they would be and I plan on ordering more. Thank you,0

My first order was not what I expected. I contacted customer service and they quickly fixed the issue. I was extremely happy with the replacement.,1
I���������m so disappointed with your t-shirt sizes. I���������ve ordered once before so I should have known better. Wanting a true XL size I ordered 3XL. They are so damn small more like a M/L and that���������s before washing. I know they shrink a lot. Unless you gu,3
Everything I have ordered looks great. #2 of my hoodies did not fit; but looks great on my daughter. My mask are slow & I really need them; still waiting. Hope all goes well with the rest of my orders. I grow & sale herbal teas; sale air plants & plants at a year around flea market. I choose to order from you. I try to dress what I sale. Thanks!,0
Shirt and stickers turned out great. Good price and fast delivery. Thanks,0
"I have ordered multiple times from TeePublic, all with excellent customer service. Unfortunately, this time the shipping was much longer than usual. I understand this is not TeePublic's fault, but it caused a birthday gift to be over a week late. With the shipping information given, there was no way to really track the item, it just vaguely said it was ""on the way.""Thankfully it was eventually received and the item quality is as expected. Thank you!",0
"Only have one suggestion.I purchased the ""Pursuit Special"" t-shirt and was disappointed that for the $23.00 price, the quality of the shirt itself is low. For that price you should be supplying premium or near premium quality shirts. This t-shirt won't last very long. Will not purchase any more shirts based on the poor quality of the one I just received.",3
I bought 4 tshirts. They r all beautiful. The artwork is amazing. Prices r gr8 & delivery was quick. Sizes r a little on the small side but I am extremely satisfied with my order. Sure I will be returning & tell my friends. Happy holidays & thank u!,0
The shirt is perfect! Thank you �������,0
Arrived pretty quickly and in good condition.Thank you!,0
The site says to order a size up because the shirts run small. I ordered an XL instead of a large and it is too small. My package arrived after what I had needed it for. The tracking information kept changing every time I checked it. Very disappointed!,3
"Ordered a t-shirt for a Christmas present on December 5 2019. Should be plenty of time for delivery from U.S. to Canada, right?Nope.Just checked the shipping status on January 2, 2020. It states that it arrived IN CANADA on December 30, 2019. It took 25 DAYS to get from East Bumf*ck, USA into Canada. Not to my house - just into Canada.One month later and I still haven't received the item intended to be a Christmas present. Maybe I can give it to the person at CHRISTMAS 2020.What a frustration. What a disappointment.",3
"Really pleased with my Tees, service and delivery was prompt and without issues, very happy. Thank you.",0
You ruined a gift & surprise for someone by not making a t shirt correctly.I���������ll absolutely not be recommending your ,4
I ordered two T-shirts they came in a timely fashion. Very nice print work. Nice selection of colors to choose from. Very happy with my purchase.,1

"I made an error with an order and support helped out a bunch. The artist had notified me about the error too and fixed it in a flash.

"I received my tank top right on time. It fits perfect. I like it but I thought the text were going to be gold , Sall good Im not that picky or good at shopping. The mask came a day later. The emails I have received in the meantime make me feel happy I chose you. Thank you.",0
Shirt was too thin in weight and the color of words printed were very faint. Would not buy here again.,4
"Very happy.Shirt received exactly as described and is of high quality, as is the design on it.",1
I purchased this pug tee shirt for my sister for Christmas. It's so hard to find tees with a black pug. And I loved I could choose the color of the tee itself. Blue is her favorite color. She absolutely loves it!! I will definitely be back to purchase another for her birthday in January. Shipping was fast and it arrived in time for Christmas. Thank you so much!,0
A little disappointed in the size. I guess I need a 2X tall rather than a3X. I don't think it will be long enough even tho it said the 3X was quite a bit longer than the 2X :( I usually get the long-tail tees from Duluth Trading.,3
Love the design. Thanks,0
"Everything I've ordered was received quickly and was exactly what I ordered, I highly recommend this company",6
"Hello, I want to testify to the excellent service I received following my order at Teepublic. Unfortunately, at the time of my order, I had not seen the wonderful Size Chart section which allows you to view the different formats.Result: the t-shirts ordered were too big. Despite the fact that I washed them, the company agreed to deliver me smaller ones for free. I am very grateful. Thank you Teepublic!",0
Received exactly what I wanted and very quick too.Thank you,0
I absolutely love my t-shirts-- thank you,0
Print not centered and very blurry. Very disappointed.,3
It took a long time to get here...but I'm guessing it was because of Covid. The XL is more like a medium.I usually take a large.So I'm disappointed with size,3
I am very satisfied with the merchandise Ipurchased. It also shipped quickly. I would definitely shop here again and tell friends about the site.,6
Some of the best shirts I have in my collection. Thank you for helping add some many fantastic and lovely designs. especially all the wonderful Pokemon designs.,0
Shipping about 10 days. The print is OK. The material looks very cheap. Even the Wal-Mart $5 T-shirt has better quality.,6
Product was exactly as listed. High quality & quick delivery. Definitely will order from again!,6
"The shirt turned out as expected but a turn-around time of just under 2 weeks is a fairly long wait-time. Add on two delays, taking the total wait time to over two weeks and 4 days past Christmas (when delivery was originally projected two days before the 25th, and that is frustrating.",5
"Ordered tshirts (wrong size) so they sent larger size and they're perfect! I love this company and their products, so I buy more when possible. Great customer service and communication, and fast shipping. Thank you all!!! Happy to support the artists.",0
My made it here faster than expected! Thank you for the best delivery service!,0
"The shirt sizes were way small. An XL either fits or are a little big on me and this one didn't come close. I also bought one for a friend and I hope she can wear hers, but I doubt it. They were very pretty but now I am going to have to send back mine and maybe hers and I will be out the shipping fees both ways and still have no shirt. I am really disappointed in this transaction.",3
Order was perfect . Thanks,0

"I ordered five masks, two of which were for my kids. Those did not seal at all over their noses, and were too thin (height from nose to chin) for my 7 year old. I love the graphics, but we won't likely use these masks much at all because they offer so little protection. Two of the adult masks were a thin material that I'm sure would not block small particles. They did have pockets for a filter, and I don't feel protected wearing them without one, which is a shame. The filter should be additional protection. These two were an accordion pattern, which unfortunately made the graphic text on them largely unreadable. The text was of course, why I bought them. The final adult mask seemed of a tighter weave, but still somewhat thin. It covered the face well enough but didn't seal great at the top. It's a real shame we don't have some kind of a standard measure for face mask safety, because I don't feel confident that any of these will serve the very important purpose for which they were intended. I'm happy to support independent artists, but masks are a matter of personal and public safety. There needs to be quality control in place.",3
We ordered the premium toddler tees and are happy with the quality. Will definitely order again!,1
Shirt good. Me happy.,1
"I was looking for a T shirtthat was ""different"" from the normal. I found one here on TeePpublic . It was for a Dodge M37 truck. I shared it with my fellow M37 lovers and hope that helped your artist sell more of these nice T shirts. I would like to hear from the artist to know what inspired him/her to draw the original. Thanks for a good product.",0
"Always a great variety of designs!Thank you for helping to make my friend's 50th birthday celebration so much fun!Fast production and delivery, thanks!",0
Good quality sweat shirt and logo looks great. Received very promptly! Thanks!,0
Print quality is nice but the shirt itself ( the blank) is very very thin with a low thread count when compared to concert merch so I was a bit disappointed but again the quality of the print was good.,3
"Saw an advertisement for TeePublic on Facebook and checked them out. The variety is outstanding. I ordered 2 tees for myself and 2 for my husband and we love them! The graphics, the fit, the material. . . Thanks TeePublic!",0
Good quality - thanks,0
The word mom is misspelled on the mug. Disappointing!,3

Our money was refunded for the second order and the new t shirts arrived in time for our group weekend away.We have just had our weekend away and they were a hit with the business owners and other customers on the trip asking where they could buy them.Thank you for your prompt service and turn around of our order.Regards Tracey",0

When I placed the order for a present for the boss my co-worker and I though the shipping cost $12.99 was high.We thought it was worth it though because we were getting 2 items before Christmas.Only 1 item was shipped and there isn't a status on the other item. It won't be here for Christmas which is disappointing.If we had known that it would be shipped late and not arrive before Christmas we would have ordered something else.It would be helpful if that information was provided at the time of order.The item we did receive is great! a good quality mug and clear photo on the mug.,3
"The artwork was great and the product arrived before expected. I am not happy with the sizing and quality of the t-shirt.

Always prefer you to others as sizing makes more sense. Also you ship in Canada which makes things much better.,6

We bought this for our daughter for her birthday. She just got it in the mail and loves it. Great quality art and hoodie. She is wearing it to ballet class as a cover up. Lots of great comments. Thank you for making her smile. We will buy from here again. ����,0
I just enjoy browsing through all the selections. Typing Anything in the search bar to see what pops up. I've been on Many t-shirt sites but the Variety with TeePublic is by far the best that I've found. More companies should follow TeePublics style & the Prices??...Perfect.,1

"Ordered the ""premium t shirt"" for youth sizes and was expecting a soft, not boxy cotton t shirt. Unfortunately, it's not soft at all. Maybe it will get better after washing.",3

"Ordered 6 shirts different types/qualities. And they are as described. One shirt came separately and quicker than the rest, it was the only one that was heavy/thicker material. It had that weird factory smell so I was worried they all were going to be like that, I had planned to wear one for my birthday and hate to wash them before I wear them. Shrinkage is a worry of mine with these love handles.... BUT the rest did not! They fit well, the premium feels great. And the designs are high quality,definitely not made is someone's basement like most IG t-shirt sellers. Ordered Sunday night, first shirt came the following Monday. The rest Wednesday. I was notified of the separation in shipments and delay. No biggie, I selected standard shipping.All in all, I will definitely again. Thanks!",0

I love the designs of both of them and two of them were gifts, I am disappoint because part of the print showed up orange and white on the computer and when I opened the product it was a pink/red color which didn't make sense at all. Also one shirt I ordered for myself isn't true to size chart stated because I even measured myself prior to ordering.",3

It was delivered in a good time. I was surprised. I ordered it December 14th in the evening and it arrived the following week. December 21st I believe. The hoodie was very bright in color and I liked the material. My son loved it by the way. Thank you guys so much.,0

The tee shirts were very poor quality. Definitely NOT worth the $48 for the two shirts received. The men���������s v-neck XL fit good. The Ladies v-neck 2xl was more like an adult small shirt.

Awesome customer Service. Thank You Danielle,0

Well made shirt husband loves it! Thanks! Great service arrived fast.K.Thompson,0
I like your variety of shirts. They are a little pricey compared to other companies. After the shipping and tax I paid a lot more for a t-shirt than I usually would. Probably won't order again because of price. Enjoy the shirts I got though,1
It was exactly what I wanted. It was reasonably priced. I received it in a timely manner even during the busy Christmas mailing crunch.,6
The t shirt transfers are not the best quality. They send like the type you can iron on in your home. I love all the designs but I was not impressed by the quality.,4
"I ordered a Christmas gift online. I was satisfied with the order process.However, more importantly, my daughter, the recipient, was very happy with the gift. Thank you.Ron",0
"I followed other reviews and sized up when I ordered but I ended up getting a really big shirt so I asked for an exchange and they quickly responded to my request. They even asked me to just keep the shirt or donate it, and they will just send a new one with the correct size. The shirt arrived after almost 2 weeks. Thanks TeePublic!",0
I was thrilled with the screen design on the t-shirt. My son is going to love it on Christmas morning. Happy I got a lg. as well. Shirts seem to run sm. First time ever using this site and didn't realize it's independent artiston this site. Happy to support and I will be back to purshase more items later. Thanks again~,0
"I'm very disappointed in the tee shirt I ordered for someone, I ordered a large because that is normally what they wear but when she received it she says it looked like it was a childs size shirt. And also it did not have the senders name on the package so she did not know whom it was from. Maybe you all need to work on you sizes and also your mailing process.",3
Shirts run small for indicated size!!Not worth returning!,4

I fell the ink used to print could be of better quality...when I ordered directly from black action tees quality was much better on shirts and ink used...overall no bad for the price because I got them on sale but at full retail I would've been upset...one shirt looks as if the ink didnt dry all the way before it was packed and its patchy,3
I ordered the wrong size and the correct size was shipped out to me just in time for Christian!Thanks for the great customer service!My cousins loved the shirts!,0
"I purchased two t-shirts for neighbors' child turning 2 this month.The child's best buddy is a dog - a Viszla.There was such a great variety of shirts that had this breed of dog for children's tees and I picked my two favorites.I liked the flexibility of the toddler sizes available, as well as variety of t-shirt colors available.The shirts arrived in time and were exactly as displayed on the website. Very pleased and presented them just this week.While the 2-yo was busy playing, his parents definitely enjoyed seeing the cute t-shirts!",1

"Wrong size and cut delivered (Women's XL arrived. Ordered Men's 3xl). No number to call, only an email where they tell you it can take a week to get back to you. It's been over a week, and nothing. Guess I bought an expensive towel to dry my car with. First and last time I will order anything through them . It's too bad, because they have some great looking shirts,",3
I ordered t-shirts but they were too small. TeePublic replaced the shirts free of charge and they fit perfectly! I will definitely order from this company again.,6

"I'm so disappointed in Teepublic. I've ordered before with great results, so eagerly placed a large order for shirts for a family Disney World trip that were to be given for Christmas presents. I ordered on December 2, well before the cutoff for Christmas delivery, with standard shipping, which should have been 7-10 days. On December 20 (15 business days later) the shirts had not yet arrived, and I emailed customer service asking for help or some way to make it right. I received a response on December 24, that the shirts should be on their way, with no mention of reparations. Unfortunately I had to travel out of town for Christmas and so was unable to give my family their gifts. They were delivered on December 26. I got home on December 28 to see the results, which were also disappointing. Some shirts were fine, but others have smudges of ink on them, and the XL ones are a different shade than the S/M/L. I wrote in again that day asking for customer service to make it right, and to date have received no answer, just an invitation to review. I'm very upset and will definitely be seeking other companies for future printing needs.",3
I got the a shirt as a Christmas present for my friend. She loves it! Thank you :),0
My great niece wanted this sweat shirt for xmas. I honestly thought it was a lot of money for a sweat shirt until i received it. It is high in quality and feels so warm. Glad i bought the sweat shirt for her.,1

"I was a little disappointed that the items I ordered were not delivered in time for Christmas. The note said 5 to 10 business days but not guaranteed by Christmas -- and it was 14 business days before Christmas, so I was holding out hope. But with the pandemic this year, it is understandable. When the items arrived, they were of good quality and excellent workmanship. Very pleased!",3

I emailed TeePublic as we were feeling a bit down that our order would not arrive in time and the rep was so empathetic and didn't even hesitate to assist. We actually received the original order on the day and the replacement the following day. I followed up to thank them and ask what to do with the duplicatw and they were open to us keeping or donating it. These small interactions had such a positive impact on our situation.

"I'm so happy I stumbled on the TeePublic website.The large selection of T-shirt styles and colors is only surpassed by the immense variety of artwork to have printed on them.There appears to be something for everyone, from musicians to hummingbird enthusiasts and branches of military service to wildlife.Chances are that whatever your interests are, you'll find something here for you or a loved one.",1
Was a bit rubbish quality and ended up being pretty expensive. Bit disappointed tbh,3

"I purchased six T-Shirts in two orders. Very happy with the quality and delivery speed of five of them. The sixth, however, is another story. The shirt in question is: ""Mediocrates Meh Good Enough"" (Sarcasm) Designed & sold by teecloud. While the shirt itself is good quality, and I love the design, the print quality is terrible. I have run the shirt through the laundry precisely twice since I received the shirt (following the tag guidelines), and already the text is so faded it's virtually illegible. Very disappointing, especially considering the comparative quality of the other shirts I got around the same time.",3
"Good Workmanship, and Quality.. thanks!",0
I loved my tee but I ordered white and the printing is in white so it can���������t be read. Really disappointed. Can I order another color? How do ,3
"My son loves his shirt! It's a perfect fit, good quality t-shirt. Thank you so much!",0
Long wait for poor quality. Took nearly a month. Size of t-shirt did fit my son perfectly but the design was poor. He got a red shirt and some parts of the graphic were white... Well they were supposed to be white but I'm guessing cheap iron-ons + red shirt= pink. I'm disappointed. Also after one wash some of the design is missing washed it inside out to try to prevent this. Waste of time and $20,3
So glad that you had what I ordered as it made a perfect gift,1

Ordered a STAN LEE /MARVEL Theme shirt and it looked very unpro! Print was very cheap looking and choppy! Very disappointed!!!,3
Every order has come to me consistently well-made and on time. My only suggestion is to make sure the women's tees are the same each time - this time my Weezer shirt was on a v-neck that was not a woman'f fit (with a cap sleeve) but I still love it and won't send it back. Thank you.,0

However the medium shirt I ordered wouldn't even fit my 11 yr old granddaughter. Worse than that, I ordered a fairly dark blue background to try and match her car. Her shirt was much darker than I anticipated with BLACK letters making her present unreadable even up close. I don't think I could be more disappointed!",3

"I am not satisfied at all with the 6 sweatshirts I ordered and will be returning them. They were all supposed to be bright orange design with white lettering on black hoodies. The white and bright orange are dull and greyish. And the actual quality of the sweatshirts themselves is poor, flimsy, and the 3XL for my son is short and he's not a tall man. I've ordered from TeePublic before and expected way better quality. I hate to have to return them but they are no where near the price I paid.So disappointed. :(",3
Tee shirts are high quality and customer service is very responsive! Would definitely recommend and will shop here again. Already a return customer!,6

I would have given 5 stars except that one of the tees was dark green (very nice color) with black writing, Dark on dark was not readable, (the tee pictured made it look like it was easily read) The writing should have been in cream or light beige. I was very disappointed in it. Other than that, I was satisfied with the purchase.",3

Shirt came on time and is what I ordered but disappointed in the quality of the printing it looks blurry it's very light and thin seems like not very much ink was used and was sticky to the touch I feel like its gonna fade away after the first wash but on the other hand it was very affordable so I guess you get what you pay for,3

Took forever to ship and the print is of really poor quality. I would not recommend.,4
"Well the delivery got delayed, which tee public stated was due to the third party carrier and needed to be resent. Not the end of the world. most of the masks I ordered look good, yet the Arnold from total recall mask was a huge disappointment. For some reason they decided to enlarge the image up to 3-4 times the average human face, so you look like a goddamn caveman or chimpanzee.",3

The products look good.Haven't worn or washed them yet to see how they feel and hold up after washing.The issue I had was the delivery time.Needed the weekend of New Year's.Ordered on 12-13-22 and it didn't ship until 12-26-22-13 days later!Was notified that it would get here by 12-30-22.Then received another notification that it wouldn't get here until 1-3-23.Didn't get notification that it was at local post office by 12-30-22.Not delivered until 1-4-23 due to weather.If I would have been notified I would have gone to post office to pick up.Disappointed on the shipping time and delivery communication.Communicated with Teepublic to have them follow up where it was at a couple of times.All I received as an answer that it was being delivered well within their shipping days allowance....they didn't take in consideration that their 3rd party company didn't ship in a timely matter in the first place...and would not do a search on it.If they would have they could have told me it was in at my local post office.Never expected it to take 22 days to receive.,3

Just as described! Thanks my daughter will love this!,0

I thought this would be the coolest gift for my son because he loves psychology. I got the enlarged order I requested but the quality is so poor that you can���������t even guess what the words are that label the brain. I honestly probably could have done a better job by downloading it from my computer and printing it off myself. Super disappointed. Improve the quality and it��,3

Disappointed. Shirt came with clear color bleeding and general discoloration in areas of the print design.,3
When I wanted to send back the tshirts. Teepublic said to just donate the shirts and they would send new upsized shirts to me. Saving me money and hassles on shipping. This made everything so incredibly easy for me. Thank you! I would of course order again and recommend to others ������������,0
I was pleased with the merchandise and the communication.,1

It took a while longer than advertised for the order to ship and I have to admit I was getting a bit nervous seeing that it was a gift for a special occasion..Once it shipped it got to me in good timing and they made up for the delay. Thank you the product looks great and I will be ordering from you guys again!,0
"This is about the shirt, not the artists. Order a size or 2 up because the shirt does shrink a lottle. Other than that i am happy with all the designs ive purchased!",1
The designs and options are on point. Since my family and myself have a range of taste. Shirt and kid hoodies were sized one under but was quickly addressed through customer support. Definitely will be ordering more in the future,6
Order placed was received in a little over a week which is what I expected. Happy with the service.,1
"I ordered 3 t-shirts each with a different printed image from three different artists. All three are not how they appeared on the screen when I choice them. The picture quality on each one is poor, lacking distinct definition of image and therefore poor quality. I will not be ordering from this website again.",4
"Love, LOVE, LOVE my Nicole Haught shirt! Thank you!",0

Designs are very cool and my family liked the colors.The shirts fit well and are pretty comfortable.Thanks again,0
Timely delivery of a quality T shirt!Thank you!,0
"I really liked the variety of options, and the ease of ordering from TeePublic. The delivery times were long, however, and we did not receive our product until the 12th business day. I understand that it was a busy time, but it was disappointing to order a product in this day of fast delivery on Dec 14th, and not receive it until Dec 31st. I was also disappointed that the graphics on one of the shirts we ordered were out of focus. Although the child was still ok with wearing the shirt (so we did not return it), for the price and the wait time, it was disappointing that it wasn't more reliable. Between my sister and myself, we ordered 4 shirts from TeePublic, and only one of them was really good quality (soft shirt, good graphic, in focus).",3
Received order in a timely manner.Happy with the merchandise.,1
It is rare today that you find such a high level of quality customer service. We ordered a sweatshirt and it had a fabric defect that wasn���������t easily noticed but would get worse with each washing. They bent over backwards to make sure we were taken care of and totally satisfied. Thank you for your integrity. Only wish I could h,0
Purchased the tough phone case for my 1 phone 7. Fit great and the artwork was perfect. Very happy and would buy from again!,1
Order accuracy is never a concern and orders are filled and shipped in very rapid manner. Shipping is a bit more but I'm happy to pay more to shop small. This is my third order and I doubt it's my last.,1
"The t-shirts we ordered are good quality and look just like they appeared on the website. They arrived in a reasonable amount of time and i had updates about shipping and access to tracking information as well. I needed to exchange a couple of shirts becausethe small seemed too small, I was ordering for several family members, so I wanted to be sure everyone had the best fit. I emailed the contact form one evening and was greeted by a response next morning explaining that the new sizes were already ordered and that no return of the other shirts was necessary. I now have received the replacements and all is well. And all in time for Christmas!So easy, painless and understanding. Thanks!",0
The quality of these t-shirts is deplorable. They are extremely thin and snag very easily. I ordered a premium long sleeve shirt and the material was so thin you could almost see through it. For the price they charge one would hope for at least a Hanes brand quality. I do not recommend their product.,4
"I am very dissatisfied with this 2xl t-shirt....NO WAY IS IT A 2 XL....SAYS IT IS ON THE TAG, BUT IT'S NO WHERE NEAR A 2 XL....I am a very disappointed customer. For 38.00 I feel ripped off.",3

Pretty disappointed. Ordered the Star Wars mug with the vintage figures on it. The print is very fuzzy and not clear at all.,3

My shirts came in a timely fashion however they look horrible! The screen printing is spotty and scratchy.The entire back of my tshirt is splotchy.The quality is really poor.Extremely disappointed and I will let everyone know not to order from here.,3

Love all my shirts from here. Just wish they made a cropped version!!Thanks!!,0
"There is no return, only exchanges for items that are not defective--per the company. I did not read that correctly before I ordered. It concerns me when companies do not stand by their products. I don't want an exchange because, per their size pics, the product fits poorly regardless of size. I did order two sizes up per their recommendation and still too small. It's a birthday gift that will be too long regardless of how much bigger I get it to make the width better. I also do not like the tri material. It's feels more like a chamios",4

"Communication was great. However, I was very disappointed in the tee-shirt. The gray is so much darker than it appeared online, so the Bulls logo hardly shows up at all --can't even tell what it is. Also the medium is very large. I'll let my 13 year old grandson decide if he wants a new one.",3
Product came fast and was very enjoyed by my co worker. Very happy with productover all,1
My granddaughter was so thrilled beyond words to find two of her favorite plays available on tee shirts. Thank you so much for making her 14 birthday special for her,0
I ordered 2 t-shirts separately as a gift for my wife for Christmas. The second order came quickly but the first was taking much longer. I emailed TeePublic and they responded promptly and reshipped and made it in time for Christmas. Unfortunately I ordered the wrong size on both and they replaced both with the correct size for free. Very refreshing to know some companies still put the customer first. Thanks.,0

"The shirts are awesome and the designs look exactly like on the site. The standard tee is very thin and good for warmer weather and the heavy duty very thick. I love supporting indy artists. My one complaint would be response time. I understand with covid eyc there are delays and staffing issues, however on my first order I never eben recieved a confirmation of order email and when I emailed them it took weeks to get a response which was an uninformative form mail. It took over 2 months for the shirt to arrive. That doesnt bother me as much as the uncertainty that I was getting it at all. I really adored the design and was kind of disappointed until yesterday when it arrived. (It amazing!). I don't expect next day response but maybe management could give more detail and say something. Even an estimate. Or maybe more then 2 emails in 2 months about it. That being said, I would recommend this teepublic bery highly and love the designs.",3

Terrible service . Unacceptable. I ordered far in advance of my son's bday. Product was received over 2 wks past his bday. No assistance on orders. I paid $$$ for the fastest shipping and didn't get my order in over a month. Customer service took a week to respond each time and was no assistance. WillNEVER use this company again. So disappointed.,3

I was really excited for this sweater but when I got it I was super disappointed. The design looks all faded and the sweater itself looks old and faded and it's just not what I paid for.,3
"I Love the Design Choices and the Prices are Great.Not sure if I'd agree that the ""higher priced, better quality Tee's"" are worth it.They don't seem any more of a better quality.I guess that my biggest disappointment is with Shipping.I thought about ordering some as Christmas Gifts, but I don't have faith that they'd arrive in time.",3

Very easy to order and the Design was on Point and Size was true as described !,6
Came as expected! Very quick too. No problems at all.,6
"This was my first purchase from Teepublic. What caught my attention was this company was helping support independent artists, and they had a lot of variety. I had high hopes as there are a lot of competitive companies out there that provide the same type of products. Where they fell short... the quality of ink they use to print on their shirts. It looks thin, like it���������s going to wear, or rub off quickly. The one green Bakugo shirt, the ink is so translucent you can see the texture of the shirt behind the image. As if it was unevenly printed in certain spots. It has a faded looked that wasn���������t mentioned on the website. Also the sizes of the prints are not equal. Some of the prints take up 80% of the shirt while others fell short and only took up 30%. When browsing online it appeared that all the prints should���������ve been uniform size. The other thing is some of the graphics were placed oddly on the shirt. Instead of having the image up neaion. After saying all that the shirts are indeed 100% cotton and they are in the range of medium softness. They are NOT starchy but they are not super soft either. Now the stickers. That was a severe disappointment. They appear to be in adequately printed. They are grainy and they not glossy they are matte. They are small in size. I do not recommend buying stickers from them. You can get the same quality from printing at home even if you have an old printer. I suggest they get some photo paper and print on that. They would be better quality and more durable stickers. If these get wet they will get destroyed! They look like they were printed on regular cold press copy paper that is sticky in the back. Even tag board would have been a better option. All in all I would buy from this company again. I did get what I ordered. Things weren���������t up to my standards but I will still proudly wear the T-shirts and advertis",3
"Ordering was easy, shipping time was reasonable and quality seems good.",6

"So, the product I received wasn't so appreciated. When I saw the picture, it had the wording on there pretty well. When I got it, the wording was in blocks. I got this as a Christmas gift and I was very disappointed when I got it. Not too sure if I'll be purchasing from here.",3

Your website is poor and difficult to deal with in regards to returns. It is not clear and cumbersome. The biggest issue is your sizes RUN SMALL.

"My last order was not what I ordered and was charged for, I order 1 shirt for 14.00and rest were 20.00 the difference was the up grade of shirt and I got all shirts of the same grade as the lower price. I don't want to go through the hassle of sending them back so I felt ripped offand don't think I will ever order from you again or recommend to anyone else",4
Being able to get movie shirts in two tone is cool but they are Asian sizes. Or kids sizes. I ordered 4 different XL shirts and they are all more like a slime fit Large at best. I recommend going at least one size up Than your usual fit. One of the shirts I ordered has either a burn mark or stain on it. White tank girl shirt.,6
Do not buy the pleated double layer mask! It's cheaply made and overpriced.,4
My wife was very happy I bought her this Tee shirt. She likes wine and we have a pontoon boat so it will be great when we are out on the boat. Thanks again,0
I got the exact badflower band shirt I wanted and tried to buy at a show and I was denied. Everybody else was outta stock.,3
"As always the quality of print is top notch and the softness of the cotton is high quality. The only draw-back I have to say is that for a size men's medium, they are slightly too long. T-shirt should cover the butt so much, but it fits great on the shoulders.Thanks again for the unique designs!",0
Easy ordering and love the variety! The print is faded and is hard to see in some spots but other than that it really enjoyed the experience,1

UPS in my area is very bad and hasn't delivered a package correctly to my address in over a year. So when this package was lost by UPS, I called them and they immediately sent me another one with no questions asked and were even so kind as to ship it FedEx for me so it wouldn't get lost again. I am beyond pleased and will definitely feel good about making additional purchases from them in the future.",1

Had a great experience with this company.The shirt i ordered was great quality but it was a woman's v neck it said to order a size up. It was still too small. A quick email to them and I fully expected to pay any price difference for switching it to a male v neck I expected a run around like I've had before from other similar companies. That was not the case woke up the next day order confirmation for the new shirt was in my inbox. Thank you Ioana for the simple process.,0

"I confess, I skeptically ordered a sweater from you not being familiar with your company and hoping it wasn't a scam. Fortunately, the product looked great and was delivered quicker than I expected. Unfortunately, it didn't fit. I needed a bigger size. Knowing you custom print, I didn't think it would be possible but in speaking with Samuel, he sent a new size out complimentary (which fit!) and allowed me to keep the other one (which I'll probably give away). No questions, no hassle. And, as someone who teaches customer service skills around the country, I must say: THAT is excellent customer service! Thank you, Samuel and TeePublic!!! I will order all future shirts/sweaters through you (and refer you to friends).",0
"The service was AMAZING!!I ordered a T-shirt but when it arrived it was a bit snug.I reached out to TeePublic to see about an exchange.Not only did they send me the next size up but told me to keep the original one too.They recommended I give it as a gift or donate it, rather than return it.This was my first time ordering from TeePublic but it certainly will not be the last.Thank you, TeePublic team!!",0

"Ordered several women's XL tops. The quality was definitely not worth the price. The shirts were very small, more like a women's medium, and the fabric was thin, see through, and super cheap. You could find better quality fabric for a $5 tee shirt anywhere else. The prints on the shirts were also slightly discolored. At least they arrived on shedule. Definitely not a quality company.Would not buy from them again.",4

The first shirt was sized for a 10yr old girl and I ordered a small men's.I'm a small ISF woman. It was nice that you replaced it but disappointing to get a huge shirt that comes half way down my thigh. Sizes shouldn't be that difficult.,3

"I was disappointed in the shirt I received. The transfer looks cheap and low quality, like an iron-on thing made with an ink jet printer.",3
"TEE Public - Service Beyond ReproachHighly recommend this business for item choices and the service provided.I placed an order for several T-shirts and used the sizing chart to select the size I thought would be correct for me. Unbeknownst to me I had the misfortune of ordering wrong sizes. On receipt of my order the mistake was discovered. I contacted Tee Public (via online) and advised my situation. I was fully prepared to return the items for replacement shirts. Tee Public's response was that they would send replacements (in the correct size), with no requirement for me to return the first items. They suggested that I gift/donate these items to another, which I did willingly to a very thankful recipient. I would not hesitate in recommending this business to others. The selection of items/goods is infinite. I only have one complaint....Too many choices available !!. I am a fan of the Tintin character and the choices available through Tee Public were so numerous....I had a lot of trouble making a final decision.In the words of that other famous character "" I'll be back....""Thank you Tee Public.",0
I had a problem with my order. I brought to the attention of customer service and they resolved my problem right away and expressed a replacement. That's what I call great business! Thank you TeePublic! I will definitely keep you in mind.,0
"Excellent! High quality, fast, couldn't be happier. Thanks to all the great artists.",0
"tried it on, fits perfectly, thanks",0
"T-shirt fabric quality was great but was overshadowed by the print on the shirt. Some parts faded and had pixelated edges like it was from an extremely low resolution pic. Two shirts were ordered with the same print. One was ""okay"" while the other was the pixelated disappointment. Whoever printed the shirt should take more pride in what they do and never let something like that out the door.",3
Excellent art. Great price...thanks for the sale. My critique is they took too long to arrive.,0
Exactly like picture. Arrived very quickly. Will definitely order more from them.,6
"Lots of variety, things you can���������t find in stores. Lots of colour varieties but still could have more. Shirts seem to be good quality, very soft,nice fit too, I����",6
My experience was nothing short of amazing! I ordered the wrong style and size originally and when I contacted you to get return information I was told to keep the shirt to donate or give to someone else! Not only that but I was told to order the correct style and size for no more money! I will definitely be telling everyone about my experience so they can order from you. Thank you ����,0

Very responsive and helpful customer service.Thanks!,0
"I gave this to my husband as part of his birthday gift, and the huge smile on his face automatically made this a 5-star review. Thanks for helping to make him happy.",0
The only reason I took 1 star away is because it took a little longer than excepted to arrive however transaction was simple and the quality is what you would except from a graphic t! Super happy with how the print looked as well!,1
My shirt turned out exactly how I hoped it would look. The large sized shirt fit correctly so it was nice to actually get it right. Large size is frequently smaller than advertised depending on which country produces the shirt. Thanks for a great product.,0
The shirt I ordered was ok in quality but nothing of the size I thought it should be. I ordered a male large and it looked more like a ladies large. Not able to give as a gift like I planned.Disappointed,3

Easy exchange and thoughtful customer service. thank you.,0
"The t-shirt quality was excellent. Ordered on my phone and didn't notice what looked later to me like screen printing errors of blurring of colours. When I contacted customer service they showed me the Internet photo which did indeed have this exact problem showing. I wasn't happy with the shirt regardless, so no annoying returns, just please pick something else and we will re-ship. No worries. Super impressed with this extremely generous offer and quick 24hr response. Thanks, will re-order on my laptop next time!",0
Great company. Lots of designs and shirts to choose from! Very happy with my order!,1

"I am a quilter, and I ordered a bunch of t shirts with my favourite singers on them to turn into a t shirt quilt. The variety of choice is really good, and I like how the graphics feel on the shirts. A couple of the designs did not turn out as well as I had hoped- one is fuzzy/unclear, and the other I think was bad choice of t shirt colour on my part.",3
"Thank you so much for working with me I finally got my order, MERRY CHRISTMAS",0
Love the shirt!!!! Thank you.,0
Wrong size. If I am paying $30 for a t shirt. Everything should be done correctly. The quality of the shirt was also underwhelming,3
Customer service helped me get my order after I gave the wrong address when ordering.Very satisfied and grateful.,0

Unimpressed.The print on the front was not as distinctive in colors as I expected. The quality of the material was what I expected for the cost.But the sizing was way off !!!!It looked like a child size xl shirt.Definitely not made for a grown woman.Pretty disappointed.,3

Item is not what I expected.

"You have an excellent variety.Prices are good and site is easy to use.I received the shirts well within the time it had said. The only recommendation would be some way to do measurements for the sizes (chest size, length etc.).I know you have the pictures to help but it still made it difficult to decide.Unfortunately there is no such thing as standard sizes in the clothing industry.Other than that, it was a great experience and I will most likely order from you again.Thank you and happy holidays!",0

"The quality of the products I've received from this company has dropped significantly in just 2 years. In 2016, I placed an order of over a dozen shirts and they were all soft, well-fitting, and the printing was clean & natural. Today I just received a large order but man was I disappointed; the shirts were not soft (more coarse), the fit was boxy, and the print was faded and looks like it was just slapped on there. I actually ordered the same shirt design/color/size from 2 years ago and the difference is night and day between the two. It's obvious a different base shirt is being used across the board. Very disappointed will not be returning in the future.",3

I paid extra for faster shipping because it was my dad's birthday. I reached out to customer service when it seemed like my order was going to be late. They didn't care. The shipping cost more than the shirt. It arrived 5 days late. Super disappointed.,3
Great!Thank you.,0

"There are two elements to service for an online order - the ordering process (i.e. the website) and the delivery.The ordering process was great - really good website.However, I placed my order on 3rd July using international delivery which is supposed to be 10-15 days. The items actually arrived on 27th July. For all I know this may be the fault of UPS (their online tracking certainly suggests that the package just sat in the same place for days on end). Either way, it was a very disappointing service and undermined the products as they were ordered as a birthday gift. UPDATE to original review: TeePublic contacted me immediately after I posted this review, apologised for the delay (even though it might have been UPS's fault), and refunded the cost of delivery. Excellent customer service that should be recognised and applauded.",3
"I love the company, the shirt designs, and pricing is fair. This last order was a disaster. Taking over a week for the shirts to get to UPS and 3 weeks total to get them isn't acceptable. I don't plan to buy anymore shirts anytime soon from Teepublic. I get that things are busy for the holidays, but this is the first time I reached out to the customer service team and I was very underwhelmed. I don't see you living up to the claim of making things right if people don't like it. After a label is created to ship my shirts and nothing happened for days, I reached out. The response I got was clearly a template that provided me my shipping number. Which I already had on-hand. I would rather have gotten no reply than a quick reply with the same info from my order confirmation email.",3

"Great service. When one was defective, I was immediately sent another, which came in time for Christmas. Thanks!",0
the hoodie itself was nice and soft but the design on it wasnt what it looked like online. it was smaller than the large print on the website. you can barely see it. i ordered a navy hoodie with a biggie print but the print was waaaaaayyyyy too small and so hard to see. it was disappointing especially for the price. i expected the print to be bigger and brighter yet it was small and dark.,3
I was totally satisfied with my purchase of 2 of your t-shirts. They were so awesome that I ordered another 2 t-shirts to give to my son for Fathers' Day. Thanks so much!,0
Really happy with the quality and fit of the v-neck tshirts. I have placed a few orders and I am always really happy with the quality of the tshirts and prints.,1
"Customer Service was not able to resolve my shipping issue and was only willing to return my payment.The rep, ""Dan"" did not go out of his way to ship the new product because of the ""customization policy of 3-5 business days"" when my products were not even customized, they were apart of the given product line offered.Tee Public is a fraud and joke of an organization.I even paid $20.00 extra for shipping on my original purchase just to be sure I would have my products on time.Tee Pubilc ruined part of my Baby Shower because of this. Thanks for nothing. Christina Vernacchia",0

Shirt quality was fantastic and the price was great. Thanks!,0
"I didn't realize TeePublic has a satisfaction guarantee for size exchanges, but it is so wonderful to know since I don't have to worry about whether an item will fit. I had bought a hoodie for my husband, who wears a medium size shirt and jacket, but when I got it in, it seemed a bit small. It was my mistake for not going a size up for a hoodie I suppose, but TeePublic was so generous to get me a large hoodie. I will definitely be shopping on TeePublic in the future for that reason alone. Thank you guys, and God bless!",0
Original tee was too small so I was told not to return & they would send a bigger size. This all took place within 10 days. Customer service is awesome! Thank you.,0

"Not completely happy. I ordered 2 items.Same design, one on a magnet, one on a button.The magnet was adorable.The button was off center.I contacted TeePublic and they said there was nothing they could do.That's how it's designed.I disagree, it looks like quality control slipped up.Regardless, the item is a piece of paper in a plastic button.There is no reason they can't center the design within the button but instead they chose to have an unhappy customer that will not order again or wear the button.",4

T Shirt I bought is great quality and the design looks exactly how it did on the website.Very happy!,1
It's a beautiful image and seems well printed. The artist is one of my favorites.But I wear a size medium (10-12) and the 2x I ordered after reading to size up in the women's tshirts...it's way too small. It's snug and uncomfortable. That's super annoying and disappointing because it cost more than a man's size or a non plus sizes ladles. I spent way too much money on something that I can not wear.,3
Great sweatshirt but runs incredibly small. I got an X-LARGE and it is far too small for me. Very disappointed,3
My work partner thoroughly enjoyed the purchase I selected from your website - a coffee mug from the television franchise Pose.

Tee shirt was high quality and as advertised. TeePublic is always reliable.,6
"The package came a day after the delivery notification, nevertheless, I got my package, thank you.",0
"The art is amazing, but I am very disappointed that TeePublic Is using cheap sweaters made my Gildan. Also I believe the art work is not woven into the sweater so there's a chance the art can peel over time. Please improve quality, do not use Gildan.",3
"Really cool t shirt. Color, design and fit were great. Thank you!",0
I am very happy with the T-shirts and delivery.A. B.,1
Quality is Great. I ordered two of the Jean- Michael Basquiat shirts to wear to King Pleasure Art Museum in New York. Thank you so much!!! Looking forward to purchasing many more items in the near future.,0
The shirts were decent. I waited 3 weeks for delivery. Disappointing,3
"Wonderful shirts,excellent artists and designs. Gracious and very helpful staff when I needed help. Incredibly pleased.Thanks",0
Arrived but kept them wrapped until our anniversary next month! Thank you very much!,0
Only did 4 stars because one of decals not as heavy and shirt shows through. But other than that I love the colors and fit. Thank you.,0
Received great customer service. Ordered wrong size & was very easy to request a larger size & quickly filled the new order. Thank you!,0
The humpty had a great fall hoodie I ordered was a gift for my mom. And for $60 it looked like like the bright and vivid picture on the website. The orange yellow and black looked all faded. And almost double printed. Very disappointing.,3
I am very happy with everything that I have purchased.,1
Shirt fit to size and design is exactly as advertised. Would use them again,6
My little great grandson love the shirt we got from you thanks,0
"My husband & I both loved our tshirts!! Looked exactly as site showed, great quality. And great support when I ordered the wrong size !! They corrected it before shipping !! Thanks. Will be re-ordering soon !",0
"It took a little while to get my shirt but WELL WORTH the wait. (Being holiday season and all) I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT! The material is great quality , nice and thick.When I first opened it it I thought it looked way too big. Tried it on and it fits perfect. I am so happy I bought it,I was really hesitant.I would definitely buy another shirt from TeePublic. (Please make more crumbl designs) TeePublic rocks! Thank you, P Mckenzie",0
"Happy with my shirt, looks good -- just took longer than expected to arrive, but that may have been Canada Post being swamped with the higher volume of packages these days...",1
"Thanks for your fast service and great packing, we loved the tshirt",0
They may have taken a little time to arrive but I understand. I'm very happy with the designs. Happy customer here,1

We LOVED All of the Tshirts we ordered!! Thank you for the wonderful designs!����,0

"Love the shirts I got, perfect thank you!",0
"Great shirt! Shipped timely, thank you.",0
The shirt I ordered was unsatisfactory.The print was very dull and faint which is NOT what the ad showed.I expected a vibrant print and am VERY disappointed in what I received,3
I really like the T-shirts. After an initial email to let me know my order was on its way I didn't get any further emails and wasn't sure how to track it so started to think I was never going to receive my order. And I read poor reviews on the web that said this company could be a scam. But got my order yesterday and happy with the quality. Especially like the pink V neck T-shirt with the staffy pic on it. So thank you!,0
The size I originally ordered was too short and when I asked if they had a tall or another size they replaced for no charge. This makes ordering a tshirt online without trying it on so much less stressful. Thanks TeePublic!,0
I had a problem with a product and was given a response and refund within hours.Very good service.Thank you.,0
"I ordered a T-shirt and face masks. I was very pleased with all products received.My order came in two shipments so when I enquired via email as to when to expect the second shipment, I received a response within 24 hours and the response was courteous and accurate.She said I would receive the parcel by December 9th, and I did.So happy with the quality of the products and the quality of the service.",1
It's a prefect fit and i love it thank you so much,0
I love it. Thanks.,0
"Thank you for exchanging the Tshirt for my girlfriend. But,the comma was missing in the word Don't. It was GOD DONT LIKE UGLY. The Tshirt was the right size this time. Thank you",0
Product was awesome. My Dad loved his predator tshirt. It took a couple days longer than I planned but the look on his face was worth it. Thank you so much.,0
"Liked the worn off look on the text. Didn't like the worn look on the image of MJ itself.Either way, still works for me. Thanks!",0
"The shirt came out nice, the order was printed prepared and shipped fast I was. Did happy",1
The quality of printing and shirt fabric was poor.Disappointed in the result for the price.,3
"My shirts were nicely made an sized correctly, my I PHONE 11 pro max cover worked great, graphics were also nicely done, thanks for the great merchandise at a reasonable price, Edward",0
I got what I ordered in the time they said it would be delivered. Can't ask for anything more than that! Thanks!,0
Fast delivery and tee shirts were great.Ordered 12 for Halloween!Thank you,0
So so happy with my order!! Everything came out great!!,1
Very happy with my purchase exactly what I wanted at a great price will recommend to friends and family,1
"Very disappointed that I paid extra for the so called ""heavy weight"" t-shirt. Th material is very thin. I have yet to receive the order I placed 2 days before the one I got. One was shipped by FedEx and the other one by the USPS, and was supposed to be a Christmas present and here it is December 29th and I still don't have it. I should have only given a two star rating. Very dissatisfied all the way around",3
"I had to get another size as my friend isn't quite as small as I thought she was. Customer service responded almost immediately telling me that my new request was already being processed. Fast, friendly service may be a cliche, but in this case it is true.",6
"They have shirts which aren���������t the usual ones. Have been happy wiyh the quality. Got my grandson 75th anniversary of d day shirt which he has outgrown and he asked for another one. This type of shirt is hard to find for kids,but",1
"I can't say enough about TeePublic. When couple of my shirts needed exchanging for a bigger size they didn't hesitate to send me new ones for free. I was told to keep the ones that don't fit (unfortunately it's such a personal shirt I can't find anyone to give it to, maybe I'll become really thin someday lol). Anyway the new ones fit perfectly I am so pleased with them and have been wearing them around. Now that I know my exact size will definitely order more from them. Thanks so much for your wonderful customer service. It's becoming really rare these days. Will definitely recommend this site to others. Keep up the good work! Thanks!",0
"Hello, I love my new shirt. However, this Large shirt seemed more like a medium. So I gave it to my sister. She really loves it. Thank you for fulfilling her Christmas wish.",0
"The order was correct,received product fairly quick",6
When the shirt arrived it was stretched at the bottom and very thin. Quality was not good at all especially if your paying $20 for a Tshirt. The color was pretty and that���������s the most I can say about it. I will never buy another shi,4

"Brilliant hoodie and prompt service, thank you!",0
I ordered two shirts for my Wife and I for Our new Indian Bike. We were informed of the wait time and are very happy with the product. The Colors were spot on and sizes too.,1
"Tee Public closed down my office after more than a year of effort from my part to upload more than 700 designs on it.I didn't receive a single mail explaining the reason of the closing and I have sent now more than 40 mails trying to get some response without any success.There's no respect for artists that spend hour and hour to get paid a very low commission on sales.I really don't recommend. Not professionals at all.If anyone wants any proof of this mails sent without any response from them, just let me know.",4
"Great fit and my 7 yr old loves it! I took a star off (but really it should only be 1/2 a star off) because the graphics got dark in hue where the details were smaller, so the characters were not as clear. However, for as many characters as they fit into this print, they were still pretty good and awesome enough for my kid to be completely psyched about it. Thank you!",0
"It took really long to receive my order. The tshirt arrive. The quality sucks. It look like is not worth 30 bucks each. One of the tshirt the thread part unravel by the arm part. Threaded not good. I cant even gift it. I sent the pic and I email teepublic but no response. Still no response. Now what the hell am I going to gift my husband for fathers day. I want my money back, well gladly send back the tshirt.",5
"I got what I order and it fit, can��������",6
"the logo tshirt that i purchased has a flaw across the lettering which the company explains was intentional and on the original design.I cant imagine that this designer intended to have that flaw.I believe it was accidental and would like to contact the designer to discuss. I dont believe the company has liability with the flaw, I believe it is the designers upload.",4
This was the first time I ordered from your company and I received all of my T-shirts the other day I was very pleased.,1
"The shirt fits great, the colors are vibrant and it is just what I wanted! I was very happy with the whole shopping experience.",1
This company has one of the best customer service departments I have had the pleasure of dealing with. They are efficient and extremely punctual with their responses to my questions and concerns. They are very customer oriented and seem to just want to please. Thank you for all your help this holiday season!,0
I accidentally ordered the wrong size of something and they were super gracious and just sent me a new one in the correct size at no additional charge! I am very happy with their service.,1

"I was highly disappointed with the quality of the 3 shirts I purchased. The images appear extremely washed out in color. They also appear fuzzy around the edges of the logos. They look as if they've been owned, worn and washed for several years despite being brand new. I would not purchase here again. Sizing was as expected and delivery was on time.",3
All of the shirts are super soft and look fantastic. My husband will love them.Thank you!!!,0
The postal service lost my order. The tracking was a dead end. They remade my order and shipped it asap! Thanks so much!,0

"The material was good, and the print on the shirt was in good condition and was on the shirt well. I'd heard some prints peeled off very easily but thankfully this one was really nice. the only issue is that it took an entire month and a half to arrive, and on top of that was a week late. The shipping cost was $7 at it's cheapest. Overall I do enjoy the product, just not the shipping.",1

Customer service fixed my problem immediately! Will definitely purchase from again.,6
"For a while I felt the shirt wouldn't come because I have never used this site before, and my father almost got scammed by a different site that takes money instead of giving the product. When I woke up to see a package for me, I felt so much relief and happiness haha. The site itself felt easy to navigate with so many options of what you wants. Which is why I kind of felt it would be too good to be true.",1
"Shirts arrived before Christmas, and they were of nice quality.Sizes were true to size. Would order again, if I need any more gifts.Thank you.",0
Thank You for keeping me informed about my order. The way You keep informing me maintains mutual trust between us.,0

Today is Dec.6th & still no masks!!!!!The 6 shirts,& the button shipped ,so l just can't understand the delay with shipping the 4 masks, which were actually the exact same design as the shirts!!!!! I am disappointed,as I actually planned on giving the shirt /mask sets as St.Nicholas Day gifts, which is today.",3
Very poor quality. Cant even read the words on the shirt. Black lettering against dark navy shirt.. so not true to size.. need to return as they were to be given as a gift. Very disappointed!,3

My experience with purchasing items from you folks was absolutely awesome! I will continue as a customer in the near future! Thank you and Godspeed!,0

Everything is fine. Thank you!,0
Very nice shirt.&prompt service.Thank you.,0
Exactly what I asked for exact size exact as the picture prompt delivery Thank you,0
The tee shirt was to have Mafia across the front but it���������s just a picture of a Buffalo. Disappointed,3
I like the fit of the shirts. This is my second order and I am disappointed to see the same color ink printed on a shirt so it is invisible.I would not have ordered blue and purple if the advertisement showed it illegible. My daughter came in last night with her new shirt on. It made me kinda queasy.,3
"TeePublic offered me exactly what I was looking for. I looked all over for the right In This Moment hoodie. I didn't find it until I looked on TeePublic. Not only did they have the print I was looking for, but they had different options on the type of hoodie I could choose from. My choice was the premium hoodie. I was very pleased once I received it. It fit perfectly, the print was amazing, and it didn't take forever to get. I would recommend TeePublic to anyone looking for amazing quality and great service. Thank you so much for my perfect hoodie!",0
"I always have fun looking through the merchandise at TeePublic.I was born in the 50's, schooled in the 60's, entered the workforce and college in the 70's, slept through the 80's and re-awakened in the 90's... Now, I have enough years in me to relive some of the times that were most meaningful.TeePublic has products representing the gamut of my experience.Items are fairly priced and arrive promptly.Have some fun and check out the merchandise...",1

Updated. See below for original review. I am still giving the original overall product a 3 star due two having issues with both the original and replacement. However customer service is top notch. Although the design I had ordered originally is no longer available they gave me the option to replace or refund.Original review: I���������m disappointed.

"I ordered something for christmas on November 25 and paid $7 for standards shipping (7-10 days). Fast forward to December 23 (essentially a full month later and a day before christmas) and the quality is subpar, the text is fuzzy, and the coloring is absolutely off.

"This would have been five stars had the graphic been printed on the cup so a right-handed person could see it. When I pick up the mug all I see is black which is very disappointing. I guess it's my fault I ordered it since it is as pictured. Other than that, the Thurman Munson graphic is great, the mug came quickly and was well packed.I would recommend that the artist put the graphic on both sides of the mug or on the side where someone picking it up with their right hand would see it.",3
This was my first two orders. I was happy but I do have some thoughts.Why are the plus sizes not available in all colors. It disappoints me when I can���������t order in a 3X a 2X is too tight.And second some of the colors are not that bright.Dull colors are not to my,3

"Very impressed: I ordered a product expected to arrive by Christmas Day and received tracking information until Dec 13. I contacted customer service Dec 30 and had a response within hours. TeePublic offered to reship the product, I agreed. They contacted me again because the product was not in stock, offered me an alternative produce and to refund the difference in payment; I agreed and received confirmation that the alternative product was being processed. All this happened Dec 30 - during the holiday period. However, the original product arrived Dec31and I immediately contacted TeePublic and was able to stop the reshipment. TeePublic customer service was extraordinarily responsive and offered to rectify the situation without question. I would highly recommend them to others and will purchase from TeePublic again.",6

"Absolutely wonderful customer service.Very responsivee to an issue I had...which Teepublic had no control over.However, they took the responsibility of correcting the matter and making it right. By taking this step, it will encourage me to keep shopping at Teepublic and recommend them to friends.Thanks!",0
"I ordered a few garments, and one t-shirt's graphic was damaged in the wash the first time. They quickly responded by replacing it after sending a few photos of the shirt. Thanks for the help!",0
"This gift was for a Christmas present and at first I received the wrong shirt and I was very disappointed.I sent a message to Tee Public with a photo of the shirt I received and the very next day the correct shirt was at my door!I was so impressed with their service, they did not make me return the other shirt and Christmas was not interrupted.The quality of the print and shirt are very good. As an artist I am considering selling with them after my positive experience. I will definitely buy from them again!",3
"I love the designs, like the light shirt weight as we live in Texas. I have ordered about eight shirts from TeePublic. I've bought both full-screen and more open designs and like both. I am disappointed that your full-screen designs tend to stick to themselves. I wash all my clothes in cold water on permanent press cycle and never put them in the dryer (really!). I have had to gently separate one section of the shirt front from the other side, or try to shake the shirt front straight before laying it flat to dry. Twice, one part of the design has stuck to itself enough to pull the design ""ink"" off and leave it on the other sticking point. This has not happened with the more ""open"" designs. I guess I'll order the open screen designs in the future.",3
Speed n nice so cool thanks to you,0
Had printing issue which was resolved in one email.Thank you,0
Super happy with my new shirts..ordered large and they fit accordingly. Will be purchasing from them again in the future and have referred a few friends to TeePublic,1
Ordered the design i wanted and i was kept updated and informed of the package and where it was at and when it would be there. The product is nice smooth and very well made and im really happy with it. I look forward to buying more from this designer.,1
First order i made and both shirts were messed up sent emails Saturday 3/12/22 and have still not heard back from anyone...This is not a very good first impression of Tee Public,4
This was a replacement shirt for an original order that was unacceptable because the printed letters weren���������t visible against the shirt color. Hanks for your prompt help ����,0
Tshirts awesome. Been such a long time since I saw that old movie. Just rewatched it so was hoping I could get the T-shirts from it. Glad you guys could deliver. Thanks.,0
"Quality of print not good. Image pixalated & you can see blue shirt in places where print did not take. Contacted teepublic & they provided a refund immediately. Disappointed with shirt, but will continue doing business with teepublic due to great customer service & quality items prior to this purchase.",3

"I had never heard of TeePublic before this order, and I will definitely be back again!I was able to find several items that I haven't been able to find anywhere else.Items look great, and were shipped super fast.Thanks, TeePublic - will be back!",0
Twice I have tried to contact you about exchanging the size and I have not heard back. It was supposed to be a Christmas present and now the shipping deadline is past AND I still do not have the right size AND have not heard back from you.,3
"Customer Service was the best ever, truly. What bugged me was that the sizes were simply incorrect. I got what I ordered according to the label, but I could barely get them on. And believe me I'm not significantly overweight. I'm not sure I could've gotten into them when I was a skinny 18! Very disappointing because the quality of the shirt itself was excellent.",3

"I wanted to start supporting more small/independent businesses by buying a t shirt from this service! I got a shirt to wear on my birthday (this sunday) and I'm so glad my shirt came not only with perfect timing, but came nicely folded and in the least amount of packaging which I am truly grateful for! I don't need a huge box with tons of filler for one shirt.....thank you so much, and I will treasure my experience years to come!",0
The pillow I received had Galatians spelled wrong: Galatiens. Disappointed!,3
"T-shirt arrived in a timely fashion (was a gift). Giftee was extremely happy with it. Got well, and got lots of compliments.",1
The shirt I got as a gift for my brother who hiked 100 miles in yellowstone this summer. The first shirt I got didn't have the Buffalo logo on the back I was pretty disappointed but contacted the company and received a new one with the logo on the back! It looks great and the t-shirt is very soft,3

"Excellent, speedy service from start to finish.And a good quality T-shirt as well!Many thanks.",0
One of the t-shirts got ruined cause my dog had gotten int the package. I feel this could have been prevented by putting the shirts in a cardboard box or putting the plastic bag package in the mail box. Other than that the t-shirts are great and really enjoy them.,1
Excellent! I even order a size too small and you were generous enough to send me a replacement and let me keep the original! I will be sure to pass it on to someone who will love it! Thanks soooo much.Will shop again soon!,0

I bought shirts for myself & family members. We absolutely loved all of them & can't wait to buy more!!! Thank you������,0
"It took a long time to receive the shirt, and when it finally came I was really disappointed. The image was very low quality, quite pixelated. It had obviously been enlarged from a low resolution image. Also, it was very different than on the website preview before I bought it - the colors were affected by the T-shirt color. Ideally, a screen of white should have been applied below the image so it showed the intended colors of the image. On the light blue T-shirt I ordered, the yellow of the image became greenish. I would return this if I could but since they are ""made to order"" I'm out $20. 1/10 would not recommend.",3
My nephew absolutely loved the shirts that were made for him. He put them on as soon as I receive them. Great quality and very well-made. Thank you so much!,0
Just what I was looking for! And thanks for the fast shipping!!,0

"I was worried that it would be delivered later than I expected, but it came three days early, and just in time to wear for the party I bought it for! Thanks!",0
Your customer service was AWESOME but the product itself was disappointing. I don't like the rubbery substance of the iron-on. Looks like it will peal off easily.Not sure if I will order from TeePublic in the future.:-/,3
We ordered several shirts and we were so happy with them. Unfortunately 2 of them did not fit as expected and one of them was sewn wrong. We reached out and they had everything resolved so quickly. Thank you for such wonderful customer service!,0
"I am very happy with the quality of the shirt and print.I got a mens Large, it seems like a XL size and I think it may be big but that's ok, its for Fathers Day so i don't want to try and send it back for a medium.But shipping was very fast, and like I said quality of the shirt is good. I would order again, just maybe a size down.",1

I ordered one size larger.I needed to order 2 sizes larger.I will never get to wear these and this was a total waste of time and money.I was very very disappointed in this product and I would not recommend this site or use it.I would like to say they contacted me after this review posted and seem so willing to make this right.They do have stellar customer service.I will update this once I receive the new T's.,3

I ordered women's shirts and I got kids shirts I'm so disappointed,3
I ordered 2 of the same style tee shirts as Christmas gifts in different colors and sizes. I was disappointed that I was sent 2 different brands of shirts. One brand was of better quality than the other.,3

Totally satisfied...will shop again and recommend.,6
The shirt is so cute... but is definitely not a mens xl... which is what I wanted! So very disappointed!,3
The shirts were exactly what I expected. I might would have appreciated a more premium heavier gage tee material but they were not see through. Sizing was accurate and my shirts arrived pretty quickly.I have shopped here again since then because I was happy.,1
Very thin shirts. I paid for them to be a better quality and what I received is disappointing.,3

"Shirts & fabric look good, but order screwed up by system. Tried to order 1 purple pride shirt to go to NJ and 2 entirely different shirts to go to Seattle. AFTER clicked submit, system changed the order for 2 shirts to match 1st order: 1 purple pride shirt to NJ and 1 purple pride shirt to Seattle. Instantly, I clicked to edit order and described the problem and what I wanted. Yet so-called Customer Service waited days to respond, said Too late to change, and Don't open, Write Return to Sender. But pkg arrived from some other name and address, so I opened it, thinking it was something else. SO DISAPPOINTING!",3
The design is perfect. Exactly as described. Fit is just right.,6
"The shirt I ordered will be the perfect gift. It's exactly what I was expecting, and the fabric feels great. Thanks again!",0
Wonderful job! Thanks so much! I will be a customer for life!,0
"You provide a good service, but your product isn't great.It doesn't stretch my face enough and is rather tight.There is no elastic in the mask at all. I was rather disappointed.",3
"Loved the designs, but there were pressing heat marks on the shirt. Disappointed due to this issue, not enough to not wear them.Fit is good.",3
It���������s exactly what I ordered. Shipping was fantastic. Thank you,0
"The whole process was very easy, convenient and fast. Would recommend.",6
"The customer service is really great.My order arrived in record time.I am a bit disappointed though, in the design application on the ""T"".It looks like it may wash off in the first washing.We'll see how it goes.",3
"Outstanding customer service, thank you!",0
"Love my new shirts...the fabric is so soft...They suggested to up-size for women's shirts, I did but will go 2 sizes up next time, the arm holes seem a bit tight.I will buy again.Thank You",0
I love the quality and unique designs offered by TeePublic but I was disappointed with the shipment process. I ordered 2 items for gifts for Christmas which were not shipped until over a week later( I ordered on Dec 9th). I was told my order would be here on Dec 21st so I wasn't to worried. Well I did not receive the items untill December 28th. I hope they can get this straightened out because no matter how unique or how good the quality of the product is if it is not at it's destination when needed it really doesn't matter. Very disappointed it wasn't here for the Christmas gift I needed it for but I will give them another try because my son's love the unique t-shirt they can get from them.,3
I really enjoy your tee shirts . The quality of your shirts are comfy and the designs are awesome. I ordered tee shirts for my sons and grandsons and they loved them . My over all rate is a 5 for excellence.,1
The t-shirt is good quality and the fit is about right. Definitely order one size up. The product shipped quickly and I was provided a tracking number.,6
"I got my shirts that I ordered.............a bit long in-waiting-for, but because of the Christmas overload of orders online, I understood the wait.Now that they're here, I am very happy.THANKS!",0
"Update! Tee public fixed my sizing issue, sending me a larger size without exchange of the smaller size. They made the process so easy and were wonderful about it all. Fixed it all very quickly. Thank you Tee public!!!",0
The one shirt already had a rip on the side and I didn't like the material I want my money back,4
"They very quickly and without charge sent out a new, larger size because the first t-shirt I ordered was too small. They told me to feel free to keep or donate the original t-shirt. They were very responsive and the whole process was seamless. Thank you to James in customer service at TeePublic!",0
"More than perfect. A better size hart for non US people would be an improvement. My ordered size is a bit too big, dut I don't mind",6
Just received my order and I'm one happy customer! The product is great quality and I will be a returning customer!,1
"Quick delivery, decent quality shirt.All good.A bit disappointed when you search the site for my pages exact name that my store page does not show up.",3

The product was easy to order and came as expected.,6

"I couldn���������t praise TeePublic more highly. The quality of work and prompt filling of my order was extremely impressive. When it turned out I���������d made an error in selecting sizes for half of my order and inquired about an exchange the TeePublic team were so understanding and immediately took steps to remedy my oversight. I thank you Maria and the team, kind regards, Karen McLean, S",0
Ordering was easy and efficient. Every step of the way I was informed regarding the shipment of product. Product was just as imaged online. Very satisfied. Love the Teeshirt. Thank you to the artist and TeePublic.,0
Exactly what it said it would be. Awesome! Thank you,0
"Was so looking forward to getting this shirt, but incredibly disappointed with the product. The graphic isn't vibrant at all, and the shirt had a hole before I even tried it on. Can't say I'd reccomend teepublic to anyone unless that person ticked me off.",3
Great products! Great prices! Thank you!,0
"My T-shirts arrived 8/27/2022. Correct size coz I took the time to understand the sizing chart and their quality is excellent. My thanks to the responsible Artists.Cheers,Artist - A E French.",0
I received exactly what I ordered.The order came in a reasonable time.,6
Product was just like described. I had been looking for a new Undertaker T-shirt. Could not have found a Cooler design for such a Great Price! Thank You!!!,0
"The phone cases are really nice and fit properly to our new phones. We ordered the phone cases hoping to find the texture to be slip resistant as the phone without the case is super slippery.We chose the ""protective"" option thinking that it would help, but, unless we missed it, the description of the case doesn't elaborate on the texture. The case does make the phone less slippery, but it's not that rubberized slip resistant feeling. The artwork is centered and looks great. If you're looking for a nice case, but are not concerned withslippage, then this is the case for you.The actual ordering process was concise and delivery was timely.TeePublic will be a site I visit again when looking for something unique to support the talented folks that sell their products.Thank you!",0
"I bought two shirts my son selected for his back-to-school wardrobe. The low-cost was great for my budget and my son liked the selection of designs. They arrived on time but the absolute best was the fabric. Soft and comfortable! And the fit was perfect! Consequently, we will be ordering more next month. Thank you, TeePublic!",0
"As always, very pleased with this service. Shirts are comfortable and hold up well in the wash. I am very happy to have found TeePublic!",1

I purchased MGB T-shirts for my son and his SO and Morris Minor T-shirts for my hubby and myself reflecting our vintage cars. I'm so happy TeePublic has a huge variety of styles and XXXX-large sizes! I plan to buy more tees from TeePublic,1

I was quite happy to get a replacement shirt after it started falling apart quickly. I did notice the replacement one's coloring wasn't as bright as the other one. Again love how it got replaced super fast though .,1
"I ordered a couple shirts for family members at Christmas. They have an exceptional variety of themes and artists that sell their work at TeePublic. I have never seen anything like it! There is something for everybody. The ordering process was quick and easy. One of the shirts was too small for the person I bought it for, they were quick to make it right and I am very happy with this company. I will be doing a lot of business with TeePublic.",1
Pillow looks good.Exactly as advertised.Thank you.,0
Quality does not quite match the price but a decent hoodie.,4
"This company is the most wonderful to buy tee shirts, etc. from.They truly care about their customers and will do whatever it takes to make sure they are happy with their order.I love the five shirts we bought for our grandchild's birthday party, they are high end and not like many companies sell that are flimsy.The customer service is awesome and gets back asap.I look forward to doing more business in the future.Thank you.",0
"All good.Communications, service and knowledge.Nice working with you and will definitely order again...Thanks",0
Tees came as advertised. Happy with purchase. No problems.,1
Almost 40 dollars for a thin tshirt that took weeks to arrive.Have yet to get the stickers I ordered.I do not recommend this site nor will I purchase from it again.,4
"You offer an AMAZING selection, and your sizing presentation is THE BEST I've ever seen (and I have many dozens of political shirts from many sources. It's also great to have so many shirt types to choose from.) Regrettably, some of my ""negative"" may not be your responsibility, but the fact that 5 of the 6 shirts I ordered are simply iron-on decals certainly is. The need to take care when washing, and then line dry those five to make them have more than a very brief lifetime seems unfortunate for the price (even on ""eternal"" sale.)Raw Story advertises you as a supplier of ""fun liberal"" shirts, and as such it's more than a little disconcerting to see so much far-right and pro-Drumpf material. I've brought that to Raw Story's attention, and I can only hope it will be a greater concern for you than it is for them (after paying $95 for an annual subscription.) I suspect I'm not the only person to cancel an order due to these items (though, admittedly, I didn't realize the magnitude until after my first order. That second order in my cart will not be completed.)Thank you for asking, and I wish you the best. (You do have some very special designs.)",0
I absolutely love the breathable material. I also appreciated the fact the the stretching of the material did not deface the writing. I will be ordering again soon. Thank you for taking pride in the work you do.One pleased customer....,0
Package came super fast! And shirt came out perfect! Really happy with my purchase.,1
They handled my size issue very well and my friend received the shirt that didn't fit and I received the correct sized shirt. Very generous of them to not want me to return the shirt that didn't fit. They were very quick with their responses and actions to resolve the issue. Thanks again,0

"Easy to work with, quick to respond to emails and make it right.",6
"Love the design, good quality shirt ,will definitely order again.thanks alot",0
The shirt was of poor quality. Very disappointed,3
They order was super delayed and all they wanted to do was give me a 30% discount on next purchase. I had to argue that I can get that discount with any coupon code online. Only then they gave me back my shipping cost. Still really disappointing considering they charge same amount as Redbubble but their items arrive faster,3
"First, the good stuff... Your product arrived in a timely fashion and I think your pricing is fair. Had it been for these two points, I would've left a 5-star rating. Unfortunately the product itself fell short. The printing is faded in some spots, there were no vibrant colors at all in the print (even though this is obviously a new shirt, the quality makes you think it's old and has been washed a multitude of times).I can almost see that after one washing, these issues would be even worse. I was happy with your service but very disappointed by the product itself. This was going to be a gift for someone who really enjoys this Netflix show but now I have to find an alternative.",3
"The first shipment of my tshirts arrived with a graphics error in that part of the design on both tshirts was cut off.I asked for redo's, and they came through 110%.I am heartbroken, like millions of others, that Nightbirde lost her valliant honorable battle with cancer.She had THE MOST positive attitude and outlook on life that I have ever seen in anyone.She was a light that shone bright the world over and I am incredibly and immeasurably grateful for her touching my life and my heart with her beauty, grace, and love.To the folks behind these tshirts, thank you for giving us a sweet reminder of Jane that we can wear close to our hearts ������������������These shirts are incredibly soft and the colors are beautiful.I am grateful for the redo",0

Package tracking is convenient and fast.,6
"I���������m pretty disappointed with the print quality and overall shirt quality. For $20 I���������d expect a fairly decent shirt, the ink and printing process look cheap, almost like it was home made. The lines are soft with bleed and the colors are faded. Also I purchased one male and one female shirt in royal blue and they are two completely different shades. I���������ve purchased plenty of tee���������s from online shops that support indie designers but this quality ",3
Item was exactly what I ordered. Thank you.,0
"I found the perfect t-shirt for my son who was turning 13 during the quarantine - especially since it was a black tee (he likes wearing black) and a nice design. The website noted that there were some delays with getting orders, but I thought I left enough time for having the shirt done and shipped to me by his birthday - 3 weeks - and the estimated delivery was about 0n his birthday. Unfortunately, there were delays and I received the shirt five days after his birthday. Therefore, he couldn't wear his unique shirt at his birthday drive-by/social distance gathering which was disappointing. However, he does have a neat shirt to wear the rest of the year. I would order again to support this company, but keep in mind the logistics and order even earlier.",3
Got my t-shirt quickly and the tracking was excellent!Thank you!,0
For some reason my grandson thought he was ordering a shirt for his mother. Maybe because of the name. But what he received was a cheesy pin that's shipping cost 3 times its amount to only be sent in a padded envelope. He was so disappointed.,3
Great costumer service helped me alot!! Went all the way to fix the issue. Just know i love you guys! Thank you will order again comfortably now.,0

I ordered a 2X. This is no more than at most a medium so it is effect unwearable and I wasted my money and disappointed a friend.,3

"Sorry to say this is the second time we have had trouble with your products.You may recall the first time was with the stealth tshirt where the design was too dark.This time I ordered a size 2x blobfish tshirt and when I opened the bag I found a tshirt that would fit my 14 year old granddaughter.The size chart stated that 2x would measure 23 inches from armhole to armhole.This tshirt measures 19 inches.On top of that the material is extremely thin and the fish decal is somewhat crooked.I do mot know what to tell you except your artists need much better quality control.I do not want any resolution to this problem I just want you to know you have an endemic problem,Thank you for listening.",0

"The prints are beautiful. BUT. The shirts, not so much. I ordered one print Men's XL and one print Women's Large. The women's large is BIGGER than the men's XL. How is that possible?And the woman's shirt is polyester and viscose, so no shrinking. I bend over? you see everything. The men's is 23 inches armpit to armpit. The woman's is 24 inches.

"My son was a big fan of power rangers when he was little. Now he has a son and I thought this would be such a great gift for him. Unsure of size I decided to go with 12m, yet he is only 4m. Thank god because the size just fit perfect, mind you the baby is small and not big what so ever, so that would not be the reason why. Then the print job, so disappointed. 1 shirt was so so faded and when the material stretched, oh god. The pic was distorted! Second one wasnt so bad, yet print was darker in some areas vs other parts was faded. At this point who knows when you wash it. I have ordered printed shirts in the past from other vendors and never did I come across this issue. I'm sorry but I wont be ordering from here again. Sucks because my son loves the Power Rangers.",3

Always comes out perfect! Sizes are correct will be ordering more!!!,6
"I seldom witness a company that corrects my mistake of choosing the wrong size by replacing a different size for free.I chose a Ladies M and it was too tight; so analyzing the size chart again, I chose a men's premium S which will not be so clingy.I was willing to send the 1st one back but Teepublic declined and is sending me the 2nd request free.What a nice gesture.Thank you Teepublic.I will visit you again.",0

never received the shirts. seen this ad on Facebook im a big godzilla fan they had tons of godzilla shirts but wasn't for sure if it a legit store due to facebook history of scam. orderd 3 shirt never arrived contacted the public tee shirt and then they disappeared. soooo disappointed 54 dollars down the drain.,3
Tracking was worthless & shipping excessive. decals poor & won't last. T-shirt wasn't heavyweight like I requested.,4
I was very happy with my purchase. Customer service was great. Very helpful and responded very quickly. I love my product. I hope my grandson will be happy with his gift. Thank you will order from this company again.,0

Material is low quality and I was extremely disappointed.When they say order 1 to 2 sizes up make sure you do bcuz it will never fit.My daughter is a size 2 and I ordered a med....still didn't fit.Had to repurchase her gift elsewhere.,3

I am extremely disappointed I purchased two shirts one for my son size 3x and one for my daughter XL both were ridiculously untrue to size The XL women's was so small it barely fit my 9 year old grandson who is in a boys largeand the 3x actually looked shorter than the woman's XL.These were supposed to be a Christmas present for both (That's not happening ),3
The graphics are great. I'm disappointed in the quality of one of the shirts. One is Hanes (blue) with is a heaver material and the other one (grey) is Gildan which I've never heard of and is a much thinner material.,3
Thanks a lot. Great fit. Awesome product,0
Great service! Very happy with my tee shirts and my mugs ! Will definitely order again!,1

I purchased a T-shirt and sized up just in case but it turned out that I needed the original size instead. I reached out to customer service and they were AMAZING!! The online exchange process was very easy to navigate. Customer service got in touch by day two which was understandable and very prompt in my opinion. They were quick to send out my exchange and let me keep the original. How awesome is that?!?! All in all the company went above and beyond my expectations and I am very pleased to have found this online store and I shall be making more purchases in the future. Thank you Teepublic!,0
I just got my shirts today and I LOVE LOVE them! They are so unique and totally compliant with me selling CBD products! I will definitely reorder in the future! Thanks so very much!,0

"Our masks are soft and good quality. They were initially a bit big, but very easy to alter with a couple of stitches. They took a few weeks to get here, probably due to COVID delays with the post. Look like they'll be fine in the washing machine. All in all very happy with purchase. Thank you.",0

Shirts all turned out good. But I personally do not like the Bella canvas shirts. Last time I ordered the shirts where a different brand and I liked the fit way better.,4
I love your satisfaction guaranteed policy. You are one of the only companies recently that I have found that stands behind their merchandise and make sure that you are 100% satisfied in every way. Thank you very much for all you are concerns regarding my T-shirt. I love the T-shirt but unfortunately it was too small and they sent me a larger one without question .,0
I ordered the Texas stars face mask. When I got it I was disappointed. The mask has 3 pleats and the T and S in Texas are under the pleats and in the corner so even when you pull all the pleats out you can not make out the T or S in Texas. The other thing that I was unhappy about was the the lettering is more on your chin than in the middle of the mask. I would definitely not recommend buying this item.,3

"Ive ordered a dozen or so shirts over the last 2 years, and even gifted out a few. Ive been a satisfied customer, thus my repeat business. I did have 1 shirt that had major issues with the image falling off of the shirt, I originally wrote it off as a cheap product, but the others held up much better. After my last purchase, I was sent this prompt for a review, so I decided to spend a few minutes in my busy life to take a picture of the shirt with the image that clearly had fallen off the shirt. Response was sorry, I didn't let them know soon enough. Fair enough. Life is busy, life is short. Would have been great to have gotten a better answer, something along the lines of, ""we see you have ordered from us numerous times, and clearly our product was not up to our standards based on your picture, heres a fair remedy""... but whatever. You asked me again for an honest review.The majority of shirts I've ordered have been great. Thanks for the variety to choose from.",0

Thanks so much.By the way, I don't plan to start wearing the shirts until I go see a theater showing of the next X-Men movie, Dark Phoenix, in June. But besides that, thanks so much.",0

"The t-shirt came on time, as expected and the thickness/quality of the shirt was excellent. Thank you!",0
The quality of the Tshirt and time it took to receive the Tshirt were all within expectation. The design I chose looked as if it was printed from a screen shot or extremely low res file. The graphic is disappointingly blurry. Very bummed that RBG is ��������,3
"So far, I'm very pleased with your product & service. I purchased this item for my daughter. But, I haven't had a chance to give it to her yet. Therefore, I may have to return it for a bigger size if she doesn't like how it fits. However, I am very confident that you will handle it in a kind & professional manner. Thank you! May GOD bless.���",0

Outstanding service and fast too. Shirt fits and looks great!Thank you so much.,0
"The t shirt I got looks great! However, personally I would have enjoyed it more if the graphic was a little larger, and the image was also slightly faded compared to the image shown on the site.

I received my order earlier than expected and it looks just like the picture. I love it! Thank you!,0

"When I received the T-shirt, I noticed a random ""period"" at the end of a word that made the printed phrase seem to make no sense. Additionally, the entire printed area was not centered. I'm a bit disappointed with the product.",3

Not impressed that I searched for something specific and was brought to a product that had a grammar error in it. My fault for missing it but I searched a specific phrase so I thought that���������s what I was getting. $18 for a grammar mistake on a 4��������� magnet��������� disappointed that I didn���������t catch the error until I was wrapping it. Hopefully it���������ll at least get ,3
"Superb customer service.The quality of the shirt is not great. The image appears faded. I was disappointed to see it. My daughter loves it, and that's all that matters.",3
The Miami Dolphin t-shirts I bought for my best friend's little 5-year old boys were BIG hit. They had grown out of the previous ones & I waited a little too long to order new ones. I was very pleased with the colors & the official logo.Thanks to the artist who designed them!!!,0
"Edited review: I originally left one star for this company because every shirt I received today was super small almost like a kids t shirt. Super frustrating!However, they responded to my exchange request promptly and messaged that they are sending me new sizes immediately. I will update When I get the new shirts. 4 stars is for their customer service trying to make it right and the quality of the designs offered.",5
"A horrendous experience, although I'll admit they tried. I ordered a T-shirt I'd been looking for a long time and added two more to make it worthwhile. The first order never arrived. To their credit, after a month, I contacted them and they sent out a new shipment. That one also took weeks to get here but finally arrived. And when I opened the package, I found that tee that I'd always wanted had a hole in the front of it. It had never been worn and now it never will be. All that aggravation I've had with this place means they've lost a potential future customer. I just don't see how they can ever make this right. They tried but they failed. Three times.I have no intention of giving them a fourth chance.",3
The shirt was too small. I normally wear an XL but decided to go a little larger by getting a 2XL.Very disappointed as I will not be able to wear it to our family Christmas Dinner. I know it would have been a hit.,3

Great service and great product. Thank you,0
Awesome! It's exactly what I was looking for. The only thing I would like to see is an adjustable strap some how. That way it would really be a one size fits all. I seem to have a larger head than most. But I am very happy with the results. Thank you.,0
"I enjoy the varieties and the quality.A tiny, teeny critique is that a couple of times the ink has faded after just a couple of washes.However, I love every shirt I have purchased, and it is a good number.Thank you !!",0
"I created a shop to sell my artwork, and the next day I received an email saying I violated the terms and my account was deleted. I had uploaded 1 piece of artwork and made 1 sale, I couldn't find anything in the terms of service that I violated, it was my own artwork. I never got the money from my sale, and I sent an email to legal to clarify why my account was deleted- I never heard back. Very fishy and annoying...",5

Easy and enjoyable process.Quick turn around!!!Terrific quality.,1
The shirts are different shades of black. The design is not as pictured and is faded. Very disappointing considering the cost. Seems almost like a cheap screen print.,3
"The product was fine, but the service was not. DHL informed me, when I contacted them to find out where my parcel was, that it was being held by Royal Mail as there was an unpaid customs fee to pay. As I don't drive and the office isn't near public transport, I had to get a cab to the collection office, and home again, which cost me ������10, and then had to pay ������12.70 customs fee on my parcel. So not only did I have the inconvenience of having to go and collect the parcel, I had to pay a total of ������22.70 extra ($28.71 approx).If you are going to offer delivery outside of the USA, then all delivery costs, including customs fees, should be included in the delivery costs. This is not the first company in the USA I have ordered from, but it is the first time I have ever had to pay an unpaid customs fee.I'm very disappointed and won",3

The three shirts were definitely a little too big so I asked them to exchange them for the next size down, all three of them. Teepublic said sure no problem, please take the three shirts that are too large and donate them. I informed TeePublic that we donate on a regular basis to a veterans group. They said wonderful, thank you for doing that. All I can say is in the next few days I will be ordering at least four more shirts from them. Robert.",0
The shirt had the custom fit of a more expensive T. Soft cotton added to the quality... Would I buy again...ABSOLUTELY YES!!,6

"DISHONEST. NO INTEGRITY! I opted infor a 15% discount to subscribe. I then noticed the discount did not show in my pay total. I sent one, two, three emailconversations that if my discount did not apply, please cancel my order and cancel my subscription. I think the email response was something like I will get an answer within 24 hrs. My first reply back from tee public was approx. two days later saying my discount could not be honored because item was on sale. That was not said on my order! That's when I sent the second and third email to cancel my order and subscription. It was obviously ignored when the next day I received an email my item was shipped. BS!! What kind of bait and switch crap is that. After my third email to TP to cancel my subscription, the response was it was cancelled. Today, approx. a week or more later, I am still getting email crap from Tee Public. As a veteran, I hold integrity to a high standard; obviously Tee Public does not. The t shirt arrived today and because of the crap Tee Public has pulled, the t shirt is crap also! I was offered the option to return it. OH, to cost me more money Not! Company is crap. Ignored my emails thinking I would not send it back, and they keep their money. Dishonest and no integrity. Terrible customer service! I wont be using them again. And from what I understand, they are connected to Redbubble, whom I will not order from again either!!!! Not the money, the principal!",5

The printing on the masks was very good but the actual size and shape was inefficient and not particularly suitable as a viable mask. It did not properly cover the mouth and nose of my 5 year old daughter. Overall disappointed with the fit of this mask.,3

I do not have time to reorder from this place or anywhere else. I will never order from here again. Ever.",3
Never got items originally ordered.Finally shipped new ones to another address then had to request another size since first too small.Could only communicate via email.Quality of merchandise is fair.Would probably never order again.This is why I do very little online shopping.Thank you.Everyone was professional and cooperative.,0

"I was looking for Argentina jerseys or tshirts about Messi. Most of them sold out, and did not really feel like using the adidas one, for some reason no size fit well after trying them in store. I ran into teepublic, first time there. Wrote ""Messi"", and to no one's surprise, a wide range of options came in front of my eyes. I picked one (to save money, cause I loved more than a few) and bought it in two different sizes just to be sure. They arrived a few days later. Nice quality, probably the image not fully as I expected. Still nice, don't get me wrong, just something unlike what I had in mind... maybe more artistic than photographic, to put it into words. But well done again, and good quality. As mentioned, one of the sizes worked, the other one was to have a back up, as I was a bit between sizes. I contacted them to share this, and they offered to send me a third tshirt for free of the size that worked, which was the cherry on top. Nice customer service, quality and overall experience at amore than reasonable priceconsidering all options and the overall process. I will definitely be visiting them and buying something else in the future. Congrats and thanks for your help.",0

Tomorrow I try on the next one.Also the company (which I knew nothing about) kept me informed along the way regarding each step of the process.Thanks,MWO, California",0
"Overall disappointed.The quality of the shirts is goo. However, the sizes are very inconsistent.I followed the recommendation of buying the next size up in women's shirts.

Shirts fit as expected but the printing is not as good as I expected....Seems like minimal amount of ink used in screening process,3
I received a couple of T shirts and the shirt are not even pregnant correctly.The color is not dark enough and on 2 of the shirts the drawing is not even centered. I was very excited for my order but when I received it I was super disappointed.,3
Mask broke even before I put it on. Would not recommend.,4
Thank you I can't wait to receive my T-shirtGreat service,0
"Ok the designs are really cool but the sizing is just atrocious. I guess they're making these clothes for extremely fat people. My wife if 5'3"" 135lbs, 32DD-25-37 and guess what? Their smallest size tee looks HUGE on her, this is supposedly the womens v-neck where they even recommend ordering two sizes up because they fit 'tight'. They clearly do not fit tight, not even remotely close to tight infact. I'm very disappointed. They have so many options yet not a single one is slim fit or tight.",3
Shipping was as expected. Order process was easy,6
I found exactly what I was looking for and was kept up to date about receiving my order and shipping. I am very happy I found this site.,1

"Quickly shipped merchandise.Site recommended purchasing a larger size for women's t'shirt and that was totally accurate.Thought the actual print might be a bit brighter - its very subdued, almost looks aged.",6
"Couldn't even get through checkout they hit me with so many captchas and js tests (i run firefox. it's fine, teepublic, you idiot), and then i had to call my card company to activate my card again. These guys are morons. When you build a website for an online store, MAKE SURE IT WORKS",5

"I have ordered many shirts from this company and have never had an issue before until now. I ordered my Biggie Smalls T-shirt in a xxxl.When I received my order yesterday, and opened it my biggie smalls shirt was a three XL but it was the worst quality shirt I have ever received from this company very disappointed.It was not the same T-shirt brand that my golden girls shirt came in in a three XL. The quality is worse than you get at Walmart. I would like the shirt reprinted and reset to me on a better quality T-shirt woman�������",3
Shipping was right on time. Product was exactly what I asked for. Print was good quality and same for the T shirt itself. Would recommend to any one who likes custom prints.,6

Our order was received in a couple of weeks and the sizes were accurate.,6
Tshirt material was very thin and the cut is small but the length is long. Very disappointed!!,3
We enjoyed looking through all the unique tee shirts. It was fun seeing different designs then the same thing on many other websites. The t-shirts are gray quality and the designs are exactly what we saw online. They shipped promptly and the prices were so affordable! All around a great experience.,1

"This isnt my first time ordering off of teepublic. But, this time, the colors on my sirt were very disappointing. The yellow was not even really yellow... The colors were very faded compared to the original picture.",3
"I don't even know where to begin with my dissatisfaction with this company and my order! I placed 3 separate orders the first 5/10, the second 5/25, and third 5/26. I received the second and third orders within 14 days. So I emailed customer service because my first order still did not have tracking. As stated on their web site I expected a 48 hour wait for a return email, 5 full business days later I finally got a reply that said shipping was 10-20 days. Incredibly unhelpful. Tracking finally posted to my order 5/31, but did not leave the facility until 6/5. The original tracking had my order arriving 6/9 and still did not arrive until 6/11. I sent another email when my order arrived because the masks look nothing like what I ordered and expected and it took over 30 days to complete even though newer orders had arrived much more quickly and they were correct. Another 5 days later Teepublic's idea of ""making it right"" was refunding my shipping. So disappointed in the whole process and feel absolutely foolish for ordering with this company in a time when how you spend your money and protect your family is critical.",3
"The images on the shirts are great, however, the sizes are not accurate���������the extra large shirt was smaller than the medium���������one size small shirt is smaller than the other size small shirt..I bought 4 shirts and on,y one is able to be worn ..very disappointed���������",3

Bought a Destiny shirt for my husband. The print is very low quality. It's not clear nor does it look like it was done professionally. More like it was done in a garage or basement. The words all have a slight blur to them. It looks really cheap. Wal-Mart has much better quality graphic Tee's for half the price. My other shirts I've ordered from here haven't come in yet. I really hope they're not like this one. Not happy with this purchase at all. Supposed to be a Christmas gift but its definitely not good enough to give as a gift.,4
Love them all magnets!Thank you!,0

"I was very excited to place my order for an SSR shirt from Captain America the First Avenger.As a cosplayer, this was a fairly simple piece which I could pair up with a generic pair of khaki slacks to do another stage in Cap's evolution.The shirt was inexpensive, the shipping was fast.However, when I received the product I was disappointed.While the quality of the material of the garment was fine, the image was not screen printed correctly on the garment.It was askew by as much as 15-20 degrees, a noticeable alignment error.This was very disappointing and it looks like I'm going to have to look for another shirt via another vendor.While I fully intend to keep the shirt as it will make for a fine undershirt to wear under my heavier cosplays, I do not intend to order from the same artist as there seems to be a complete lack of Quality Control in effect.",3

Very disappointed - Ordered shirts late November 2021 and paid an extra shipping fee (in addition to the cost of the shirts) for GURANTEED delivery before Christmas. Shirts arrived 10th January 2022. On Christmas day I was short of gifts (i.e. these shirts) as I believed ''guaranteed delivery before Christmas'' meant exactly that! Suffice to say I will never buy from them again and even a full refund cant fix the bad experience/memory of being short of gifts on Christmas day.,3

"I ordered a coffee cup. It hadn't arrived after 10 days and tracking info only said it had been sent to its first DHL location. I called DHL; they said to call the company because this couldn't be right. I contacted TeePublic; they quickly sent another coffee cup. Next thing you know, my first order arrived (11 days after ordering it). It is one of those small cups (shouldn't be called a ""mug"") no one uses anymore, and the image is only on one side, and it's on the side where a right-handed drinker would not be able to see it, when drinking! TeePublic, you should offer this mug in a larger, realistic size, and put the image on both sides. And get it together when it comes to shipping. Oh--I got the second one today. Two mugs, both mediocre. So silly. Oh well, now my friend can have twice the laughs. Long story short, pretty disappointing all the way around.",3

TeePublic is a very great website that helps independent artists get their products sold. It helped me come up with unique Christmas presents this year! Shipping was quick and the product was in great condition. Only downside to my purchase would be that the size medium was pretty big and larger than I expected it to be. Nothing too serious though. I really enjoy my experience using this company.,1

My sweatshirt was poorly made. The emblem I ordered on it was blurry and looked to be washed out. It was a gift and I unfortunately still gave it away as it was late being shipped to me.

But again minor and from a ""talking distance"" people don't notice it at all",1

I ordered a shirt for my boyfriend for Christmas. Paid for first class shipping so it would be here by Christmas.

The shipping (that I paid double for was fast) but the shirt is terrible. The print is dull with a matte finish. No shine. No glitter. It looks very cheap. I'm very disappointed and will be sending back for a full refund.,3

I will update again once replacement shirt is received.I am very disappointed with the shirt I ordered. It is very thin material and the picture on the front is blurred. I will not order from this company again.",3

If you touch the spots it makes your fingers greasy. It's awful. They were supposed to be Christmas presents. I'm extremely disappointed.

"I got my shirts after waiting two months, I get the shirts the quality sucks it's like they were made for a short fat guy the graphics are way too big to be putting on the front of the shirt,should just put it on the back instead, I could go on needles to say I feel as if I wasted my time and money, and I got a bunch of shirts I will never wear, gee thanks.",0
The shirts were decent quality and nice looking but the delivery process was a sham.

"***EDIT-UPDATE: 01/28/23***I was contacted and the reps worked quickly to right a situation which other retailers likely would have just seen as my oversight and sent me on my way. I���������m really impressed. My heavier weight t shirts are on the way now! Be advised, the standard shirt is thin and it may not be what you���������re looking for. But the good news is, you can shop with confidence knowing TeePublic has your back if you aren���������t satisfied. I learned my lesson and will keep ordering from here. You should too! The designs are awesome and the service is stellar! ******I���������ve ordered through Teepublic once before, and I was incredibly pleased with the service, speed, and quality of the products. Long story short, this time felt like a bust due to: 1) a lag in shipping (I recognize it was right after the holidays but it didn���������t ship for like 10 business days). 2) Ultimately, the shirts I orderey all immediately shrank and significantly, despite washing on cool temp. I guess I must have paid the extra money for a thicker material last time or something? I���������m so incredibly disappointed and will ultimately give away $100.00 wor",3

Prices are low. T-shirt quality is good. The print process isn't great. It feels like a rubbery almost tacky to the touch. They do not feel great. Disappointed but no returns because of the return policy.,3
Truthfully I didn't know much about the site at all until I was browsing at random and just happened to stumble upon them. This is my 3rd time ordering with them because the quality of the art as well as the quality of the clothing is definitely a huge plus for me when I'm searching out some nice tees to wear.

"I enjoyed the designs and the t-shirts are good quality. The fit was pretty good. My only complaint was the user interface; my time left to check out kept popping up in the way of looking at things. To be honest, I would probably have bought more t-shirts if I hadn't felt rushed and interrupted every few seconds.",1
"Since this is my first order, I haven't had the pleasure of any type of experience. I was going to order other things but felt the shipping was a bit high. I don't mind paying shipping, just standard was too much. Maybefive or more shipping could be free then again maybe not. My grandson going to love this tee thanks Ms.K",0
Thanks for using Next Level brand t-shirts!,0
"The images on the shirt are incomplete and difficult to make out.I intended to give this shirt as a gift but honestly I don't think the recipient would be able to read what is on it, which would defeat the purpose.",4

"I have ordered from this website several times over a one year period. I really like the art available for shirts. My issue is with the website. The search is practically useless. I can type in the exact name on a design I am looking for specifically & it doesn���������t pop right up. I end up looking through 50 pages to find what I want. Also, the site asks me constantly to prove I am not a bot (very irritating). Next, there are times when it gives me very little time to purchase what���������s in my cart. Since the search doesn���������t work sometimes it takes a while to find the designs I wish to order. I have walked away from an order simply because I couldn���������t find what I wanted in the allotted time. Something else that I am unhappy about is it seems each time I order I get a different brand of sweatshirt. Since all brands fit differently, that can be an issue. I will continu",3

Great product. Fast service. Thank u !,0
"Thank you Tee Public! You always aim to please, and it's much appreciated! However I will admit one of the tees I ordered arrived looking a bit different than the picture. It's a shark coming out of a pocket, and for some reason, you can barely see the pocket, so it just looks like a half a shark on the shirt. It still looks cool, but not what I thought. Other than that all is well. I'm always happy with my tees so I don't like to nitpick over something so minor. Thanks again,",0
I ordered 7 different shirts and they all came out great! Also very happy with the quick turnaround time.,1

Website was easy to navigate and I was able to find exactly what I wanted. Shipping process was quick; especially for it to be a busy season with the holidays.

The tee that I received is great. It fits really well and the quality is well made. I will be buying more tees from TeePublic.Thanks!,0

So far I've had no issue with TeePublic. Always pleased with my purchases.,1
"I buy a lot of tee shirts (I have over 50) and am known for my tee shirts at work and in my social circle. I've used all kinds of online sites, from 6 Dollar Shirts (not bad for the price!) to Redbubble (great quality printing). I had high hopes for TeePublic, but I'm disappointed as the printing on this shirt is pixilated (jagged squares) on the edges and blobby with colors overlapping in the middle. The picture on the site looked sharp. The actual shirt is average quality (fabric a little thin and neck ring a little narrow) compared to a premium tee like Vans or Champion. I'd send it back, but I'm way too lazy.",3
"Fast delivery! Exactly what I wanted, thank u!",0
"So, the design is great and the shirt is super comfy. But there is one major issue.

Always a pleasure doing business with Tee Public.The quality of the printing is great and the collection of different designs is huge. Thanks alot!,0
"I love the design, but the quality of the print is terrible. I washed it for the first time inside out, no dryer, and the image was cracked and partially peeled off. Really disappointing.",3
Thank you very much ���,0
Super happy with my purchase! I ordered a hoodie and it came a little smaller than I thought. I contacted them and they immediately shipped out a bigger size. Could not have had better customer service.,1
I was upset because I paid for express shipping because I needed one of my shirts by the end of the week and my expected delivery time was the following Monday. I sent an email complaining and expressing my disappointment and low and behold my shirts showed up that Friday. I was extremely surprised and impressed. I also felt like a jerk for the email I sent. I love this company! The only problem I have is that I don't have enough money to buy all the awesome shirt designs they carry. Keep up the great work!,3
"Thanks, nice shirts",0
"I found some cool tee shirts, had fun looking thru all the different Categories and bought some shirts.",1

Very nice tee shirt and sweatshirt. Thanks. I have been looking forLutheran Rose items.,0

Shirt came in perfect condition.I already started wearing it. Thanks!,0
Website is very user friendly. Order was processed and shipped as provided.,6

Great quality and arrived before it was scheduled. Thank you so much!,0
It was very obvious the t-shirt I received was not printed well. The design is barely visible. I would think for a specialty t-shirt costing $30 that a little more skill would have gone into printing the design. This was a disappointing gift to have to give to someone.,3
Thank you! Your customer service was outstanding!,0

I needed the shirts for the next weekend, so 5 business days was perfect, as the shirts should arrive on that Friday at the latest. However, the shirts didn���������t arrive until the following Monday, which was extremely disappointing as I ordered them for a family vacation and was obviously unable to use them. When they arrived, two shirts which were the exact same color and design had different color designs and two shirts that were supposed to be the exact same color were not. After spending over $100 on this order, I expected better. I would not recommend this company and will not be",3
Great shirt . Thanks .,0
Lots of T-shirts to choose from. My husband is an 80���������s guru so this site it the place to go! Thank you for great selections! So much more than 80���������s too. I even bough,0
I normally am a standard Small in size. I weigh 114-115. I read a review to go up one size I did. Medium was still tight. Tee Public said they will send a large. I got the large today fits perfect. To avoid the mistake of sizing go up 2 sizes or even 3. Hope Tee Public will fix their sizing. I want to get my husband a Tesla tee too but not sure again how men���������s sizing is. He is a medium in standard size so let me know how many sizes to go up. But I thank the company for making this issue right. More power,0

"The ""GO MOD"" on the T shirt was far more faded than the photos presented...a little lame....disappointing.",3
"I received the wrong color shirt. I was politely advised I could not exchange the item unless it was damaged (as is clearly stated online). But I was also offered a discount, if I wanted to order again, in a different color. After more carefully re-reading the website, and not having the budget for another order, I would just have to accept what I got.However, within less than 24 hours, I received no fewer than 3 TeePublix texts, assuring me I would be sent another shirt, in my preferred color, at no cost! And that I was welcome to keep the first order - to keep, donate, or gift, as I chose.TeePublic went above and beyond in customer service, which in turn, afforded me the opportunity to make a donation that was greatly appreciated! Five stars, TeePublic! Thank you again, and stay safe and well. (My daughter *loves* your podcast!)Anne B.",0

You guys are great. Thank you!,0
"This company claims they want their customers to be 100% satisfied but does not offer returns if you are not satisfied with the product. Only a replacement, unless there is a defect. The product is advertised as 100 % cotton but feels like some sort of weird stretchy type of synthetic material. Highly disappointed. So, this is money wasted.",3
Ordered the God and Country Music coffee mug.The letters on God are so dim you cannot see it.Very disappointed as this was a birthday gift for a dear friend.,3

The correct shirt is already on its way with no problem and no fuss. Great job!",1
"Great Customer Service!Although the color of the shirt was not quite correct (we sports fans are a finicky bunch),TeePublic immediately offered an exchange and credited my account for the price difference.Moreover, they offered to let me keep the original shirt.Thanks for the follow up.",0

The shirts arrived on time and were nicely packaged. Unfortunately we were disappointed in the print colors. Black shirts with Tampa Bay logo - the red was off. More terracotta than red.,3
"I ordered three tees. The price was very reasonable. The shirts arrived fairly promptly. Two of the three tees were great, just as expected. The third, however, was a disappointment. The lettering was poorly adhered to the surface and a number of letters are damaged. I am not all that picky. But I would not have sent the Lake George New York shirt to a customer. I have always been pleased with TeePublic in the past. I hope that this was an anomaly.",3

"When I ordered my Tee, I was pleased with the correspondence, alerting me that delivery may takea while. That was not a problem. I ordered a light blue ""Be Kind"" tee. I am typically a size 8 and wear a size M. When I received my shirt, it was labeled a M.The problem is that I believe it wasincorrectly sized. I could barely get the shirt on. I was so disappointed that it was so tight. Even the sleeves were tight! Instead of returning the shirt, knowing it would take another 3 1/2 weeks to receive it, I mailed it to my niece who is a size 3.I was also disappointed that the white lettering was so light against the blue color, that it was difficult to see it. I would suggest using a dark contrasting color.",3
"Item arrived on time the week before Christmas. Shirt quality was expected. Design was as pictured. However screen print quality was very poor. Top of screen print is thin, can see shirt through the print, bottom of the print looks better. Disappointed in the overall quality of the shirt.",3

I ordered a bunch of masks for my teenaged grandkids and they LOVED them.They fit well and reflect their personality while staying in school guidelines for attire - always a plus.Only problem I had was with a tee shirt I got for myself.Was a 3x but was so small that my granddaughter who is 15 could wear it.That was disappointing.,3

"I am extremely disappointed in my experience with my shirt order from TeePublic. I placed an order on 5/4/2019 for an ���������asphalt��������� colored shirt which is a dark grey according to the picture. This shirt was ordered for a very special autistic 10 year old boy for his birthday. On 5/7/2019, I received an email confirming my order had been shipped via DHL with 7-10 days shipping. On 5/20/19, 13 days later the package was finally delivered to said birthday boy and when his mom sent me a picture of him in the shirt as a thank you I noticed the s",3
Everything was as ordered Thanks for doing this order,0
"Products themselves aren't too bad. Service is awful. I reached out a week after I ordered since I'd heard nothing since, no response. Over two weeks after the expected delivery date the package finally arrived, only then did they contact me back telling me that may package had been delivered. Likely won't ever be buying anything from TeePublic again.Update: The sweatshirt was warped, arms were extremely baggy and the torso was very tight. The image was also pretty blurry and faded. Extremely frustrated.",5
"While the picture is what I wanted, I am very unhappy about the actual size. It is a Christmas gift for a grand child. We have to mount it and then mail it in time to get it to him for Christmas. *I thought I was getting a 18x24"" poster. *The actual picture on the poster is 14 x 16"". The rest of the poster is white border.NOT what I expected!The quality of the paper and picture are nice but I have no use for quality paper that has to be cut off and thrown away.I would normally return it but there isn't enough time to find another like poster in the size I requested.",3
The service was just okay.Luckily my package arrived the day before Christmas Eve.,1
"Fast shipping and good service, but the actual mask i ordered didn't look much like the picture. It was supposed to be the Rocky Horror lips but it looks so cartoon-y and not right. I'll still use it but it wasn't what I was expecting.",3
Great T-shirt design!Thank you.,0
"I'm enjoying the art I ordered and it was fun to browse through your selections.Fast delivery: I ordered the end of November and received everything in plenty of time for Christmas giving. No excess packaging, though some was in tyvec-type plastic bags. My art came in a cardboard mailer (yay!).I was warned online that one of the T-shirts I ordered ran small, which was good to know.",1
"Top notch...couldn't ask for better!I ordered two shirts for my sister for Christmas and once I got them (in a very timely manner!) I realized the size wouldn't be right. Having ordered from other such sites, I was afraid I was stuck with them, but customer service couldn't have have been nicer or more helpful. They not only GAVE me the sizes I needed, but they didn't charge me for thenew ones and told me to keep the old ones! They have a customer for life. This is one of the best online shopping experiences I've ever had. And knowing I""m helping independent artists is all the sweeter! Thank you!",0

"My sticker of my podcast logo was fine but the skin color on the same logo was off on my t-shirt.Edit 7/23/19:I contacted customer service as instructed and received a quick response by the next day. Due to the quality of the initial logo, the shirt could not be reprinted. However, I was offered a replacement with any print of my choice or a refund. I chose a replacement print from the same artist and am eagerly awaiting the t-shirt. I���������m sure that the next shirt will be fine so I updated my rating from 4 to 5 stars in anticipation of that. Thanks so ",0

"Item recieved was not what I expected. For the amount I paid for one, I could have made multiple myself at home. I find it odd that such a simple NZ souviner has to be made in a different country.Overpriced and disappointing to recieve....especially after 37 days from ordering",3
The screwed up my order . But with one email fixed and shipped my order. I love my order. Thanks guys and gals.������������,0

"Wearing My Covid 19 Survivor shirt has been part of a bigger healing process. Thanks for a clean design which helps to open conversations(albeit thru a mask) Being able to tell my story, spread hope and inform others about the virus feels as good as your high quality cotton fabric.I look forward to my second order- Covid Survivor in Spanish!",0
I was a little disappointed with the shirt. I thought it was a low quality tee shirt.,3
"Thank you! The T-shirt I ordered for a Christmas present arrived on time, and was awesome!",0
I ordered 2 tee shirts for my kids birthdays on 5/10/2020 and did not receive them until 06/04/2020 (26 days after the order was placed). So needless we DID NOT receive the tee shirts until after their birthday. That alone is super disappointing. But on top of all that the image on both shirts looked blurry and on top of that I have washed them once and the image is already faded a lot. I paid almost $55 on very bad quality and service. I would NEVER use this website again.,3
"The coffee mug was perfect. It was simple enough for my son who doesn't like over the top designs but had enough detail for him to likeit. A job well done, thank you.",0
My son spilled a little food on his sweatshirt. When he went to wipe it off some of the printing came off too. Then he washed it and a bunch more came off. He had worn it only a few times yet it looks like it has had years or wear and tear. This is completely unacceptable for the price I paid. I will not order from Teepublic again.,4
The order was incorrect.I ordered four purple tee shirts and got three purple and one black also one has a one inch gap in seam on side of tee-shirt,4

"Hello Folks, I recently purchased a mask. I wanted to both protect myself and support artists. I selected one with Owls on it. My Spirit Animal is an Owl. It arrived and is magnificent however one of the ear straps is broken. This may sound like a disappointment but it is quite the opposite. When I showed my pal how beautiful my mask is, he told me about a little girl in our neighborhood. She saw her Grandfather have a bit of trouble with the ear straps of his mask. They were irritating and sometimes came off. She altered it by putting an elastic strap that went around his head. She has since done so for other neighbors. If the straps on my lovely mask were intact I would have been deprived of the joy that this young child is dispensing. So I am thrilled. I got not only a unique mask but a wee bit of magic as well. Thank You and please thank the artist for me. Be way better than well, be happy, Brian",0
Thanks for the cool shirt hope this organization keeps producing lots of cool shirts and logos.,0

The masks took a over a month to come in which I completely understand with Covid however after waiting so long one of the masks was the wrong design and we never received 2 that we ordered.

4th shirt. The fit seems to be true to size but each shirt is stiff and very scratchy. Also the smell is very bad. A strong chemical smell that last past 1st washing. I am soaking the shirts in fabric softner to try and resolve the stiffness. I paid $30 for each shirt after hearing how soft these shirts were. I was disappointed to feel how scratchy they were. And they all were ordered apart from each other on separate orders and all have the same feel and odor.,3

"You mentioned that your t-shirts run small so I ordered a 2X, what I got was a small medium it was labeled 2X but it only went two-thirds of the way across my chest I would have needed to order a 5 or 6X in order to have it fit.

The t-shirt i bought was exactly like the picture which is the best. I can trust to buy and know what I am getting. The sizes run a bit small in the women's shirts.,6

"I bought ���������Play Cars on Daddys Back Gift For Dad Massage Tee T-Shirt��������� and expected the design to be printed on the back, which is the whole point of it- you can lie down and your child can move cars along the road. It came printed on the front, I contacted customer services and they said that it���������s supposed to be printed on the front..?! They won���������t give me a refund and offered to give me another design, which isn���������t what I want. I���������m really disappointed that I���������ve wasted my money, and disappointed that they���������re selling products under false pretences and don���������",3
Incredibly disappointed in the experience!Took forever for the shirt to get to me. To top it off the shirt is tiny! I thought it was the wrong size..its not. I have worn an Mens L for most of my adult life. I had a hard time even pulling it over my body when trying it on.Ive never had sizing on a T-shirt be this far off....not sure there is a solution?,3
I am always pleased with my TeePublic purchase.Thank you so much!,0
"I am so disappointed with these shirts not only, are the men���������s and women���������s colors a different shade of blue, but the print job is lackluster. Looks nothing like the print online, I am going to return and ask for a refund these were suppose to be gifts for my girlfriends, and no",3
"Hi, I have ordered before but the quality of the hoodie was not what I had expected. I turned the hoodie inside out and washed it. The yellow on the hoodie faded a lot with just one washing. I will be hesitant to order again. Thank you",0
T-shirt is great very happy with the purchase I will be buying more t-shirts,1
Always a bit hesitant to order without seeing and touching but reviews were so positive I went for it. Easy ordering and items arrived quickly. Thanks!I will order from y'all again,0
My husband loves it! It fits perfect! Thank you!,0
"I think the design is super cool but the quality of the tee shirt was disappointing. ""Softest in the business""? Not at all accurate. I ordered a medium because I wanted this to fit a little loose. Good thing I did, it fits like a small. I haven't washed it yet, crossing my fingers it doesn't shrink. The quality of the cotton makes me think it will. The design applique looks like the kind that cracks and peels off easily, so I'll be taking extra care of it in the wash.",3

"I have ordered t-shirts through TeePublic before without a problem. This time around, I ordered the wrong size and style shirts by mistake. Customer service responded quickly to my request for an exchange and after I picked out the same imaged t-shirts in the new, correct size, they said I could keep the original ones that I ordered to recycle or give away. That is more than fair! Thank you, TeePublic!",0
I got just what I wanted.Thank you!,0
First time customer and I ordered the wrong shirt size.They sent a replacement out right away.Thank you for a great product and service.,0

"Top quality sweatshirt, really soft and comfortable. The print was great. I needed an exchange for sizes and these guys let me keep the old ones and simply replaced it free of charge, they even waived my shipping fee from the USA as the size I needed wasn't available to order from in the UK. Absolutely phenomenal. Best company I've ever dealt with hands down. Everything was in perfect order and the purchase journey was seamlessly smooth. Customer service was impeccable, really helpful and speedy responses. Exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended and will certainly be a returning customer. Thank you!",0

"I placed my order for five t-shirts in early November, hoping to get them in time to give as Christmas presents. I tried using the tracking number associated with my shipment, with zero luck. I ended up waiting under February before contacting your customer service to see what had happened. I actually waited that long because I knew there were global supply chain issues due to Covid, etc. Your customer service person waived the delivery fee of $19.00, which was nice. I then had to wait for my order to be shipped again. It took until early March before I received it. I then had to pay an additional $25.00 in duties. When I finally opened the package, three of five t-shirts looked like they had been made in someone's basement. The screen printing was faded in some areas, blurry in others. Two were very nice quality, with clear printing and no blurriness. Overall I was extremely disappointed with my order. I will not be using your company again. The only reason I gave a rating of ""poor"" rather than ""bad"" was your customer service person was very polite and offered to refund the delivery fee.",3

"The variety of shirts is great, and I would give a rating of five stars in all areas with two exceptions. I purchased seven shirts before and all were perfect. I just received my most recent order, and I am very disappointed with one of the shirts. The logo is not the right color, and the image is blurry. I found another site similar to TeePublic, and they have the same shirt design with the correct logo color, and the image is not blurry at all. My other issue is now that I found two similar sites, like TeePublic that sell shirts made by individual artists, TeePublic is a couple dollars more than the other sites, and they offer a no questions asked return policy.

So, a bit disappointed in the quality of the material used.",3

Nothing makes me happier than a new and unique t-shirt! I've yet to be let down on anything I've ordered from TeePublic!,1
I purchased two shirts. One was the thin purple line (in support of security work) and the other was a Bouncer support shirt that had the letters spelled out with the elements of the periodic table. I found both t shirts quite unique and very creative on both artists part. I am a former Security Officer and Bouncer and I think there is a need to support these professions which are quite under appreciated and at times not respected and sometimes criticized harshly. Bottom line is that both artists put great thought and used great skill in creating each T-shirt. I am somewhat of a frequent customer of Tee Public and I am satisfied every time. Artists are essential! Thank you artists and Tee Public.,0

I've found that the fit differs from the tee shirt brand name to brand name. I can't wear a Medium in the Hanes Brand. And I can't wear a Medium in the Gildan brand. Regardless of the measurement. Can you tell us the brand name of the tee shirt you plan to use for the design. That would help me buy a tee shirt that would fit. Thank you for giving me a chance to give my opinion.,0

Thanks. All just as ordered.,0
Printing was not the best. The screen printing didn't take in some areas and there are spots in the text that look faded and scratched off already. It looks like it's been through a year of washes even though it's brand new.,4
Amazing shipping and no words can describe how happy I feel right now,1

"I ordered a handful of shirts, which took 10 days to arrive (despite a shipping time of 6-8 days), and when tracking showed me that they had not yet shipped, I requested the order be cancelled (I ordered them for a trip, and would not receive them in time), but they billed me the day after my cancellation request and sent the shirts anyway. When I got the order, the shirt about which I was most excited still had part of it's silk-screen template sticker attached and the large graphic was positioned so far off center that the shirt is basically unwearable in public. I've ordered from TeePublic before and was pleased, but this order was disappointing in multiple ways.",3

It turned out it was not a defect in the production of the shirt but as they pointed out it was in the original design of the shirt if you look closely. They were correct, however because they thought I was not satisfied they offered me a credit, I told them it wasn't necessary and that I would just keep the shirt. They said okay, keep the shirt and here is the credit towards your next purchase too! It is rare in this day and age to find a company that is responsive to your concerns and more than helpful to resolve them!! Thank you Tee Public couldn't be more professional.Also my wife is not happy with my latest purchase she said it is just asking for trouble... I kind of told here that was the idea!!""""More Respect for Others....""",0
Awesome shirt! Great quality! Thank you!,0

"We ordered a second sweatshirt to replace the one my son lost. While my son loved the design, when the sweatshirt arrived it did not look to be in new condition. He even asked why it looked used. The design was cracked in several places, and I doubt it will stand up to any more than a few washings. Disappointed with this particular item.",3
I got my order quickly as promised. I love the designs. Unfortunately 1 of my items was damaged. The customer service is fantastic. I have a replacement on the way and I get to skip the hassle of returning the damaged item. I will continue to shop with you with that kind of customer support. Thank You,0
The print quality is not as good as I've received from other vendors.,4
"Graphics were great!The shirt size is the problem.I ordered a 2XL because I wanted to use it as a sleep shirt.The 2XL looks more like a large or possiblyan XL and I normally buy a size L.I guess I should have ordered a 4X to get the size I wanted. Other than being aware of how small the shirts are, the graphics are great.Stephan has contacted me and I have sent photos of the shirt I received. Hopefully we can resolve the issue. Thank you for contacting me.",0
"I ordered two YOGA shirts Female XXL, I normally buy a size 12. I have already the YOGA Balance shirt in orange/black in XL and it fits nice. Your sizes are so far off that I would not know what to order in the future, therefore I consider it: Lost money, lesson learned.A very unhappy customer",3

I'm uncertain if the recipient will wear it.",3

I purchased a face mask (Rixta Tees) and two long sleeve tshirts. The stitching on the face mask was crooked and rough.

Cute tee's at an affordable price. Items arrive in timely fashion also! Thanks TeePublic!,0

"This is a fantastic place to buy items that you could never find in stores. I've bought several types of items with different themes. Tee shirts, mugs, pictures, stickers and masks. Everything was exceptionally high quality. I absolutely LOVE this site because you will not find the unique themes of what the artist offers! Thank you TEEPUBLIC!!!",0
"Very nice. I found TeePublic by accident when I saw somebody wearing a t-shirt with something written in Krakoan (look it up) and thought that I would really like something like that and one google later I was a happy X-men fan. And a happy Trekkie and I also satisfied my Longing for a t-shirt to commemorate my long standing devotion to the Legion of SuperHeroes. So if you're a Sci-Fi or comic book aficionado TeePublic might just be the enabler you're looking for. Remember each purchase supports an independent artist, and that's a good thing.",1

Not only did they respond quickly, they completed my order and got it to me a couple days before they said it would come! Amazing customer service, quality, and overall experience! I cannot express my gratitude in words. Thanks again!",0
The printing on the hoodie I ordered was bad.The lettering was broken where it was not properly pressed.I can't imagine that someone did not see this prior to mailing out.I would rather had not received the order than to receive this poor quality print! The T-shirt I ordered the print looks great but the size of XL youth is small. It is not like other Youth XL I have ordered from other sites.Very disappointed!,3
The shirt came just as advertised and in a timely manner.Step-son is very happy.,1
My shirts came with blue ink stains! Very disappointing!,3

Everything was correct and made to exactly my preferences.Couldn't be happier with their products.,6
The shirts were awesome!My daughter has not taken hers off. Says it is her new favorite shirt. Thank you,0
"Order a shirt a size up from what I normally wear (a medium instead of small).It was much too small.Customer service said they would replace it and sent me their sizing chart.Although it sounds embarrassing to say I had to order a 2XL, it fits very well and should still fit well if it shrinks.No problem, no extra cost and friendly service.Thank you.Love it.",0
My wife is a structural engineer and a proud graduate of UCONN and she absolutely loved the tee shirt. Thank you,0

I had a tee shirt that was defective. The company rushed a replacement. I am so happy with my many purchases and customer service.,1
The shirt that I ordered is a birthday present. I am very disappointed about the quality. It is a little bit faded and on a very thin shirt. In order for it to arrive in time for the birthday I had to pay extra to have it shipped. Unfortunately though the product did not live up to the cost. I'm not sure if I will be ordering from teepublic again.,3
The customer service is outstanding. I had an issue with a size I ordered and they replaced it! Thank you!,0
Ordered 2 shirts the same color and they were different tones...shirt sizes are smaller than the actual size. Do not recommend. The colors are very faint. Very disappointing!!!,3
"I like the design on my tee but was disappointed it was an iron on image. Maybe the design will soften in the wash, but as it stands now it���������s a little on the plastic side. Ink is always better!I like the narrow fit of my tee and that�������",3
One of the t-shirts has a big hole in the arm. Customer service replied in 2 days stating a replacement is being sent. I took one star off because two out of five of the shirts I ordered don���������t have a sharp image. I agree with ordering a size up for women�,6
Product was as advertised and on time. I am happy.,1
Very Happy with our tees love that you can choose any design you want! Thank You and will recommend to friends!!,0
"Outside of some shipping issues, which wasn't Teepublic's fault, my order was perfect. I'm super happy with my tee and pretty much buying out their whole shop now.",1
"The shirt I ordered had a typo on it.I contacted customer service and was told that is how it is advertised on the website and sure enough it is.Why would you sell a shirt with a misspelled word on it?The customer service person was nice enough to send me any other shirt I wanted, but I was very disappointed not to be able to wear the shirt I ordered.I feel like I was tricked.",3
Super happy with my order. The size was on point and the quality of the print and shirt were great! Thank you!,0
"I placed an order and TeePublic had my old address on file, which is where the order was delivered.Completely my mistake.I emailed them and let them know that I couldn't pick my order up from the old home.I received a second order in less than two days.Absolutely overjoyed.You have earned a loyal customer by providing outstanding service.Thank you.",0

"Shirts and sweatshirt I ordered were good quality.However, I was a bit disappointed that a part of print design seemed to be bleeding.They werebirthday gifts so I didn���������t have time to exchange.And I just rushed the delivery",3
Not as advertised! Designs are good but very low quality prints! My printer can print better than this. I would not recommend this and return this item as well.,4
"I ordered 6 t-shirts, 6 different artist,I had never heard of this website. Just stumbled on it by accident. I will say you did not disappoint.I absolutely love everyone of them. Thank you!! I will be ordering more.",0
Graphics looked good but these shirts run really small! I normally wear a ladies M/L and ordered a L for myself and an XL for my daughter.I am going to have to keep the XL for myself and return the L and order her a lot larger size! Bummer :(,3
"The shirts I ordered were the correct design and came in a timely fashion, however the design itself is pretty light, looks faded and strongly smelled of paint as soon as I opened the package. Probably won't order again unless I can't find a design anywhere else. A few bucks cheaper than other sites, but would rather spend the money to get a better print.",6
The extra soft was so so soft.. I adore that you guys support smaller games as well. Thanks so much for such a fun comfy shirt! *Shadan*!,0
"Fast delivery,good good quality shirts and at a fair price too. Thank you.",0
Ordered t-shirts for vacation and paid extra for fast shipping (4-7 business days) to assure they were here on time for me to take on vacation. I was notified on the 7th day that they would not be delivered until the 8th day (tomorrow) - the t-shirts would be delivered a day later than what I paid for resulting in not being able to take the t-shirts with me on vacation. This is disappointing and frustrating since I paid extra for express shipping and did not receive the t-shirts.,3
"nice quality lost my tees but they sent replacement, now thats customer service thank you",0
"Disappointed in the color choices due to being sold out. Also, the child sizing wasn't clear and I ordered my son's shirt too big. I do love all the awesome designs though.",3
"Quick delivery and great product.The B-17 picture ""almost home"" is excellent, and the picture blends in well with the color of the high quality t shirt. Thanks!",0
Came on time and the shirts were very soft. I'm extremely happy with TeePublic!,1
I am very happy with the artwork and the lightweight material of the mask. I did get them for my granddaughter who has a Australian Shepherd and she is quite pleased with them. Thank you,0
I had no issues with the product quality; and the package was on time for delivery before Christmas. I enjoyed my experience!,1
Got the merchandise early and I���������m very pleased,1
I was satisfied with the selection of the v-neck t-shirt I purchased I gladly paid the extra cost I was very happy with the graphic but the quality of the shirt was lacking for the price. The material is very thin and will be worn out and tethered only after a couple wears. I can go and get Ralph Lauren v-neck for $18 I know the quality is there they will last.,1
Exactly what I was looking for. You all are awesome. Thank you.,0
The sweatshirt i ordered for my boyfriend was a surprise and he loved it! Shipping was so fast and we���������re both so happy. Thank you!! Will defi,0
I received my order today. The shirt feels like a rag. I bought this shirt to wear for basketball season this year I doubt if it makes it through first game. I'm glad I only paid $20.18. Design is really low on shirt. Very Disappointed. I will never order from this site again.,3
This is my first order and I ordered a man`s long sleeve Dark Green Shirt with Vince McMahon on it. It came out exactly as it was pictured and I was extremely happy with it. I have not found anywhere else that had any sort of Vince McMahon memorabilia until I ran across TeePublic. I will order from you again that`s for sure!,1
"I appreciate TeePublic finally mailing me a realistic sizetshirt to what I had ordered, but disappointed in the low quality and outrageous hot pink of the larger size shirt that was eventually sent. not a shirt for wearing out on the cruise and sadly not worth the cost paid. Lesson learned.",3
I was very happy with the tee-shirt.The fact that it is unique makes it even better.,1
"I���������m very happy with the t shirts I received, my grandchildren will love them. They arrived so quickly too, a very pleasant",1

Very happy with all the shirts I ordered. Designs are cool and my daughter just loves hers. Would prefer if the t shirts used were tagless; though.,1

TeePublic and your extremely fun products you sell.I hope to bring you new business.Again, I thank you for being such a remarkable company, thanks, Bonnie",0
I was so excited when I ordered but was very disappointed with how faint the picture was & it was so small. Not worth $30 I would have tired to return it if I would have got the bigger size like I was at first. The quality of it just wasn't it.,3
"Bought the shirts for my brother in law for his birthday, and had them shipped to him!He loved them, thank you",0
"Great quality and exactly as I ordered. Quick shipping, too. Thank you!",0
I had to contact tee public because my package never came and said it was lost. I was told that another would be sent right away no questions asked. The next day I received an email that my package was sent and would arrive before Christmas. My package did cone as said and everything turned out good for Christmas I really appreciate everything that was done to male sure this was able to happen.

"We ordered a size 3X and wear a large normally, wanted the T-shirt to be extra roomy.Well the 3X was too small, much too small, no way it was the correct size!Also the fabric is very thin and flimsy.Overall we are extremely disappointed with this purchase, the size and quality were not as advertised.",3
The design on the shirt was much lower quality than I expected. It was blurry and felt cheap.,3

This was the first time I had placed an order with Tee public. Overall I was very pleased with my purchase. However I was disappointed with their sizing chart. It was difficult to follow and although the T-shirts we ordered fit we would have liked to have more room in them. They did not align with standard sizes for women so it was difficult to judge.,3
The shirts came in lovely andexactly what we ordered! The sizes just run a touch too small so I recommend ordering a size up. Will be purchasing from this company again. Thank you!,0

Tracking numbers given are pretty much useless; the tees arrived out of the blue and in a brightly-branded package that the gift recipient picked up from our mailbox instead of me. Thanks for that.

Got V-necks and the 100 percent cotton appears to be in great quality.",1

"I got 5 sticker and 3 tee's in my order. The sticker came right way and are incredible. The tee shirt took the entire 15days to arrive, not a problem,the staff keep me informed. Much appreciated. The reason for not being 5 stars is the one shirt I got was for a girl and I got it in a girl size. When the shirt came and it was for barbie XL not real life girl XL. VERY disappointing",3
Well done. Thanks.,0
"Hey guys, so I was quite disappointed with the quality of print on this t-shirt. It seemed like a fuzzy, out of focus inkjet print of some kind, instead of the sweet one-color silk screen press that the design looked like online. Its clearly meant to be a single color print design (all black ink), and I got it on a red shirt, and some of the negative spaces are actually randomly printed white! Perhaps its my fault for not deducing a better idea of what the final product would look like. The t-shirt itself is quite nice, good fabric, etc. But yeesh. I feel like a paid a quality price (30 bucks + tax for a kids t-shirt), and got a subpar print that I would have never paid for if seen in person.",3
"Edit: I haven���������t been able to wear the shirt other than a quick try on. Just a bit ago I was folding it and I saw a hole in the sleeve. Not only is it overly small, not the most comfortable material, but it���������s also low quality material that isn���������t sewn at the seams well. Completely disappointed bc I���������ve been waiting for this shirt for over a month just to be let down.The pictures on the shirts turned out great but even after following the sizing photos and the suggestion to go up a size or two in my normal shirt I felt my shirt was way too tight around the waist without any give. I like my clothes to be a bit more loose fitting. My husband got a shirt and he bounces in between a L and XL, so to play it safe we got an XL. It looks huge and long on him. But my XL is skin tight and looks child sized. I���������m half his size by the way and not a large woman. Because of the inconsistency of the sll have to shop at other retailers that offer free returns and exchanges. Also his shirt was very soft and mine was scratchy and not as cozy as I would have hoped. I wish the artists would use one or two different brands of shirts so you know what you may be getting in terms of size and feel.",3
Emails are responded to within 1 business day. Very accommodating and easy to work with. Website is very user friendly. I will definitely order more from your site. Thank you.,0
"I get so many compliments on my T-shirt Delivery was fast, I'm totally satified. Thank you",0
Fast shipping great shirts and 4x for a big guy that's awesome thank you for supporting veterans,0
The t-shirt took two weeks to arrive as this was a gift money was taken out of my account immediately and put into UPS expedited shipping without my authority period with the extra price for shipping it was more than the t-shirt it arrived late anyway period and I had a pay more period and then this person's birthday there for the gift not arriving on time also how I order the shirt on one day and the next day when it shipped it was $14 and set $13 when I originally ordered it all I will not be ordering anything from this company again- I wish I could write the reply. Thanks for your kindness and worriness. And thanks for the reminder about how hard it is for deliveries to be delivered around Christmas time that's why I did it earlier. That's why I thought expedite shipping from the UPS not the postal service and expedited it would be not a problem and considering you charge me for expedited shipping without my request. So it arrived on the regular timely fast and it would have arrived. But you charged more now I have to read your response... Yeah thanks. I don't even think a human being responded to that. Thanks but no thanks much love thoughts and prayers,0
Awesome! Thank you,0

The quality of the product was terrible.I clearly ordered adult shirts and I think we received junior sizes.I was very disappointed and will not order again from your company.It really is a shame because your customer service gets an A+.,3
"Design is great, t-shirt material quality was fine, but the quality of the screen print was pretty poor. Not thrilled :/",3
"I wear a medium shirt, sometimes small in adult sizes. I ordered a medium and it fits my 8 year old daughter. Very disappointed. Also, when I have gotten shirts from here in the past the design starts to come off in just a few washes. Very disappointing, and very expensive for the quality of the image longevity and the t-shirt material. I just bought my own design cut out machine for $300. At $25 a pop for TeePublic, I can make about 4 shirts for that price now with better quality iron on and t-shirt material. Whatever their screening material is it is terrible. Washes off fast.",3
You resolved my problem perfectly and very nicely.,6

"I ordered a T-shirt from TeePublic as a Christmas gift for a friend who I hadn't seen in a while.I did see her shortly before the holiday and after receiving the shirt, realized that the size I ordered might be too small for her.I contacted Michael, a representative who went ahead and processed my order for a larger size shirt and told me I didn't need to return the original one, that I could keep or donate it.I had no hope or assurance that the replacement would arrive by Dec. 25th but it did in fact arrive in the mail a couple of days before Christmas.As a result of your prompt attention to the matter, I was able to deliver both gifts to my friend on Christmas day, as a Scorpio, she was thrilled with the design of the phoenix on the shirt, and it made what might have been a disappointing experience really special as well as increasing the likelihood that I will be doing business with you in the future.Thanks again, TeePublic!!",0

"Shipped extremely late and quality wasn���������t great. Basically lied to me on several occasions after guaranteeing Christmas delivery. I ordered end of November (27th) with guaranteed Christmas delivery (that I paid for). Didn���������t receive shirts until Jan 6th is 7th. Luckily I disputed the charge with my credit card. 1 of the shirts was fairly well made but other 3 were like hobby lobby iron ons. Terrible quality, bad customer service",3

"I ordered shirts specifically for Father's day a week before Father's day and paid extra for 3-5 day shipping so that I would get them in time. But unfortunately, I did not receive them until a week after Father's Day. 2 shirts ended up costing me about $75 which is absoluyely insane considering I did not get them in time.

"I really like the designs and the ability to pick what color and quality t-shirt/hoodie you want; however, two of my recent orders were messed up. One I ordered a medium and received a large. The other, the quality of the print was bad (orange was yellow and art blurry). This is really disappointing because I really like the designs offered from this website but not sure it is worth waiting to receive and then having to go through the filing a complaint process. They happily fix but something needs to be done about quality control.",3

Product received late after themed birthday party but was glad to get full refund,1
"I've gotten four shirts from them, and the quality of them has been absolutely horrible. All of them look like they were printed with an ink cartridge that needed to be changed months ago. Clearly visible vertical lines in all of the prints, color that comes off in random spots after a single wash. The majority of the design on one of the shirts wasn't even visible when I got it. They let me pick a different design as a replacement, but again, it looked like they printed it with a cartridge that was nearly out of ink. I'm very disappointed, because they have a lot of designs on their site that I would love to have on shirts, but because of the fact that 100% of the shirts I've gotten from them have been such poor quality, I will not be purchasing anything from them in the future.",3
Good service. Thank you,0

The colour of the Snoopy Christmas print was very poor. What should have been Christmas red was more an insipid orange colour. Very disappointing compared to the colour shown on the web page.,3

"Once TeePublic customer service representatives ensured that I understood their return policy and reviewed the evidence of the defective tee shirt, they were more than courteous and apologetic about the trouble I'd had to go through and arranged for a replacement right away.I was struck by the personal tone they'd taken and the speed with which they addressed the situation.Many thanks!",0

"Design is very nice but the final product does not looks neat as the picture, needless to say the ultra cheap quality of the t-shirt, plenty of wrinkles and dirty (very), there is no way to use it without a wash. I guess you can have better options, since I paid in total more than $30 for the product. I still like the design very much, so if you have a decent t-shirt to print (clean and neat), please let me know. Thank you!",0

I have tried to reach out this company via email to exchange items I���������ve bought and I have not received any response in almost over a week. There is no other way to contact this company. I almost feel I just lost out on $55 on tshirts that won���������t be used. If I could give 0 stars,3
The T-shirts I ordered are good quality. Print quality appears to be very good. Exactly what I ordered and expected. Thank you!,0
I was really looking forward to receiving my shirt. The tshirt material was not what I was expecting. I wore it one time and it tore from the sleeves. I was very disappointed,3

"The shirts are wonderful with great designs and are extremely comfortable. Definitely worth the purchase. In regards to other aspects, there was a point when I backed out on a purchase for a friend, opting to go in a different direction after asking for his opinion. The process of cancelling the existing order was painless and simple and I'm glad for it. My only issue was that at the same time I ordered the shirts I also purchased several sets of stickers of other designs I liked, and despite being ordered together, were shipped separately and arrived almost two weeks after the shirts. The point of the purchase was the shirts, which as mentioned are great! But it is rather disappointing that everything didn't arrive together.",3
Awesome Patrick Bateman Christmas sweater ! Thanks !,0
"Wanted to try my luck and try to sell my designs on this platform. So uploaded my first design with myrecent project with hand drawings of a blackbird and sunflowers (on stripe background) to check out how it will perform. After one month TeePublic sent me an email that they are terminating my account due to me violating the T&C.... I was in a shock! And still I am! I sent them few emails asking for details andexplanation how I violated the rules. Never heard from them again. I don't mind, if they don't like my design but being told off the very rude way is not acceptable! Sadly after 3 months, my project is still indexed in Google and leads to TeePublic and obviously redirected to some else's project with similar project's name. So trying my luck turned out not so lucky.",3

The shirt color selection is very nice, especially the pink, but blue could be a brighter in the women's as in the men's but that would be my only complaint. Thanks so much to the independent artist for creating this masterpiece.",0

Ordered a hoodie of snoopy playing the piano in size medium.The material had no stretch so the person couldn't get it over his head. Now I can't return it and have to get a large and hope that it's not too big. I have many sweatshirts and hoodies and the material has stretch and give to them. Never saw a sweatshirt made this way.

Ordered long sleeve tshirt that is too small. Wanted 2X but got xxl these are to different sizes. Not offered to exchange or refund. Not good customer service. Will not buy anymore merchandise from this website.,4
The printing quality is bottom of the barrel. It looks and feels like it was printed on an inkjet from the 90s. Disappointing.,3
My son loved the tee shirt!Delivered as promised.Ordering was a breeze!Thanks!,0
Great artwork! Thanks,0
I bought a shirt with a One Punch Man design. I was very happy to have the shirt. But the print did not even last one wash. The disappointment I feel is unmatched.,3
"I was charged $10.99 for shipping on a t shirt from Fayetteville, NC to Southport, NC. That's like 2 hours away. I've had t shirts shippied from California for only $3.99. Thanks, but I won't be ordering again",0

Ordered 2 T-shirts and a sticker in late November. One shirt was supposed to be a 2XL and the other a 3XL. Sticker never arrived. Finally received shirts today. The print was good and liked the shirts fine. Except they were both XL. Very disappointing. Will probably never order from them again.,3
The shirts were way to small after you washed them and smelt of vinegar once they arrived in the mail. Graphics were also poor quality. Would not buy from this company again.,4
Really happy with my shirt. It arrived quickly and was exactly what I ordered.,1
"I picked my shirts, made my order and they delivered exactly what I ordered in less time than I had thought. Very happy.",1

"I really like the designs. The price was awesome. The delivery time was longer than I expected- but when I consider that I ordered from several different designers, then I understood. I ordered 13 shirts.I was disappointed in 2 of the shirts. The Mathelete shirt did not look good at all. There was not enough contrast between the color of the shirt and the print, so ""Mathelete"" gets lost and looks low quality. The Purrist shirt is such an awesome design and it was so bright on the web page, but the screenprinting process was very blotchy and the design turned out very dull, it was the shirt I was most excited about and my biggest disappointment. These are Christmas gifts and I do not have time to reorder now(received them yesterday) so now I have to buy another gift somewhere else.",3
"cool, sent me exactly what i wanted",6
I really liked the sweatshirt that I ordered but I paid for express delivery and it did not arrive on time.,3
None of the items I ordered (for Christmas mind you) looked anything like the quality advertised on the website. The colors were nowhere near the vibrancy advertised by your website. Everything was so washed out and blurry even. Looked more weathered to me. So deceiving. Shipping was also a mess. Arrived 3 days late was told by UPS that it was lost.,3

I was unhappy with the shipping time. I ordered on December 11 for a Christmas gift. It was supposed to be delivered by December 24 but didn't arrive until December 28. Needless to say it wasn't in time for Christmas. If you can't ship any faster you shouldn't promise to have it to me by Christmas.,3
Excellent service and product. Thanks,0
The shirt looks and fits just as advertised.,6

"The refrigerator magnet I ordered was so tiny you couldn't even read the details, and the material, instead of being metal, was like one of those cheesy store magnets you get from Dominoes.I was very disappointed. It's almost like you went out of your way to spend the tiniest amount of money you could get away with and still bilk me for full price. Never order from you guys again.Got a NICE metal magnet from Cafe Press for about the same price.",3

The real disappointment was the delivery and the lack of transparency regarding delivery on their website. I contacted the customer services and was told it was with the royal mail however the notifications on USPS tracker told a different story. I will not be using this site again even if and when things back to normal. The masks themselves are fine. It just everything else with the TeePublic is the issue.,3
Had a question about an order and the customer service section was great fast and efficient. Thank you,0
The shirts that ordered were better than I had expected and I received them quicker than anticipated as well.Thanks a bunch!,0

"I purchased a Doctor Who hoodie from TeePublic and I'm not too happy with it. I love Doctor Who and have been a long-time fan of the show so I was ecstatic to order this. The hoodie was almost $45 so for that price I was expecting it to be a better quality. The faces of the doctors came out looking very distorted, almost like the faces melted during the transfer process, they really looked nothing like the Doctor's at all which was very disappointing. I washed the hoodie before wearing it, I turned the hoodie inside out and followed the washing instructions. Well, the fabric just pilled up in the wash, I didn't know if I was going to have a sweater left after I saw all that loose shredded-up fabric in my washer. I let the sweater air dry on a hanger, I wasn't going to take a chance of the dryer shredding it further or melting the design worse than it already was. When I was finally able to wear the sweater it was a little snug. I ordered a 3x because I like my sweaters baggy, I usually wear a 2x but decide to order a size up after thoroughly reading the size chart on the website. I should have ordered a 4x because the sweater was fitting like a 1x. I'm not very happy and want to exchange it for all these problems but it took a week to arrive so I can't even imagine how long it would take to return it.",3
Your shirt was fine but your sizing was way off.I put in the height and you said large so that was what I ordered even though she usually is a medium. Shirt is too small very disappointed now I have to return and it took a n extremely long time for you to get it to me. Glad the concert isn�������,3

My t-shirt is nice but it is seriously small for a size medium. My other t-shirts are all mediums so i was confident in ordering a medium. This medium is really small though and there is no way I can use it. Very disappointing.,3
I really enjoyed the TeePublic buying experience- the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars- is because they had no option to group all shipments together. I'd rather save money on shipping- so I can spend more on the artists.,1
Nice weight shirt and the graphic of the aircraft I worked on in the Air Force was top notch. Thanks,0

two of my shirts came with stains that wont come out. It appears to be some kind of adhesive on the front of 2 of the shirts. $20 a piece for shirts with prominent stains on them. I won;t make this mistake again. What a waste of money,5

"I was looking for something to let my far away high school girl friends know they're special to me all these years later.Since we're heading to a yoga weekend in a few weeks, I thought a Tee with an appropriate saying would be useful and fun.I found it for the right price on your website.The message was perfect (Your vibe attracts your tribe) and the razor back shirt type made it a bit different than the regular tee shirt.The shirts were delivered when promised and I know they'll be a hit come November.Nothing but a good experience here.",1

"The hoodie that I purchased was very nice. The only minor problem is that the white color was a bit translucent and ended up being pink with the red of the hoodie. That's OK as she likes pink bunnies too! The size is correct and the hoodie was a bit heavier than I thought it would be, That's good because it will be a winter wear item.",6

June 2023I love the product; it is as advertised.Thank you,0
I really like the selection however I don't like the cart timer at all. And sometimes I will see stuff that I need to buy at a later time and it seems like you have to dig forever even when typing in keywords to find the product that you were looking at before. Other than that it's pretty squared away.,4
Super fast delivery high quality T-shirt very pleased Thanks,0
Material difficult to breath through. Glasses fogged up due to breath going up instead of through fabric.Also material cut on one of masks.Would not recommend.,4
Loved my shirts. Thanks so much!,0
The shirt looks nothing like the picture I ordered from. It was black and hot pink what I got was black and light pink. And the reason I ordered the shirt was cause it showed tiny littleRhine stones.

Several purchases and 100% happy with them all...,1
"We were disappointed when we receive our sweatshirt. My daughter picked it out for a good friend's birthday. Little did I know the logo was silk screened onto a scratchy $5 Gildan sweatshirt. So, we were overcharged at $45. Next time I'll opt to pay the extra $5 for a higher quality from Fanatics.",3

It was shipped by ups then it sat for days with no movement before being dropped off at usps for delivery, which took a few more days. I almost put a claim in, I thought the package was lost when there was no movement?",3

"Service/delivery was fine.I bought the shirt thinking it was from TeePublic and the last shirt from TeePublic fit great.This shirt not so much.The shoulder seems on the old shirt are 7 inches with the new shirt shoulder seems are 5 inches.The old shirt is a proper length the new shirt is way to long.Also the new shirt is very thin where the old shirt is a nice thicker cotton.I do like the graphics, however, it is not roomy enough up top and way to long on the bottom.I order a tee shirt not a mini-skirt.I do not like this new shirt very much and likely will return it.Had I known this was from some independent manufacturer / ""independent artists"", whatever that means I likely would not have made the purchase.Looks like an acceptable alternative would be urban outfitters.Shame on your guys. Sincerely",4
"The sizing is off by a great deal - I ordered a size 3XL and I'll be lucky if it fits my 10year old granddaughter.My own fault for not reviewing the sizing chart more carefully.Very disappointed, but my granddaughter will probably be delighted",3

Poor quality face masks and shirts. I will not order TeePublic again.,4
"I ordered some masks and one arrived. The art was beautiful and the mask was well made. I understand that Covid has made things much harder for international delivery but I'm a little disappointed that Canada takes just as long to deliver as some other countries no where near the United States. Otherwise, great products and service!",3
"I bought two tee shirts and they were exchanged for the next size up, at no extra cost or bother. I am really pleased.",1

They sent the wrong size and the wrong color and the design was not even totally visible. And they have not responded to my email yet where I let them know the errors. I think this was my first and last time ordering from them. Very disappointed.,3

"When ordering, a little info if sizes run smaller, ordered a 2x and it looked like it would fit a teen age not an adult that wears that size. And for 30 bucks a pop because of shipping. Not happy with the product, but was ok with the quickness of the return. I thank you for that. But probably wont be ordering from this sight again. Thanks",0
The sizing of the T-shirts were much smaller than when buying off the rack but when I asked to exchange them the service I received from Tee Public was excellent and the shirts in a bigger size were promptly posted off to me.I am impressed with the efficiency and politeness I have experienced.Many thanks.,0

"I purchased a BFG mug and t-shirt on July 19th. the mug didn't come till just over a month later and I am still waiting for the t-shirt. I bought them in the hope for aus father's day. I would think that seeing and sorting items that are purchased by one person buying 2 items at the same time and going to the same address, the items would be sent together??!! Very disappointed in the delivery service. Didn't seem logical. If both items came in the same package then my review would be better.",3
Very grateful for replacing tee shirts that were ordered wrong. Received them today and they are perfect. Thank you.,0
I ordered 5 shirts and none of them fit. I ordered from you before and that shirt was a 2x and fit fine. This time the shirts were way too tight.

"Having the correct t-shirt design with the options for a specific complimentary color made choosing TeePublic a no brainer. I could not find what I wanted anywhere else on the net.

Completely disappointed with the response I received after spending a considerable amount of money on products and receiving some very expensive and terribly made face masks that i could not return and be refunded after the website stated that refunds and returns were easy. NO THEY ARE NOT and I have been stuck with more than $45 of horrible face masks. Terrible service and not able to live up to promises.,3

The t shirt I ordered was a great design but so cheaply made. I thought the sizing was off. I ordered a xl and it looked to be a med/large. The screen print was pealing in spots. Very disappointed. A last minute Christmas gift that I didn't have time to return. Never again.,3

Love the designs available but the inconsistency in the t-shirt quality is a bummer. I ordered a premium that wasn't the nice thick type I typically get which was a disappointment. When I reached out to support I was basically told types can vary and it is what it is.,3

"2 issues that really are a problem for me - 1) the sizes are not even close to what they claim.- I had them re-send me a different cut, etc - I ordered it 2 sizes larger than the size I needed, but it JUST fits! - and my second issue is that this new shirts material is very thin and cheap feeling - like what you get at one of those 2 for $5 tee shirt places at the tourist traps... I am giving a ZERO star for the product and a 4 star for the Customer service which was very good I have to say esp in this day and age. - but the quality of the product and the sizes are just not enough for me to return... if CS is reading this - I'd really appreciate a refund at this point...

"Quality was much lower than expected.I would return it if I could, but it's not worth the hassle and return shipping cost. I paid an extra $14 for fast shipping only to be really disappointed by the quality of the emblem.I can tell if it's poor silkscreen or a really poor quality iron on, but either way, I won't be purchasing again.",3

good product thanks y'all.,0
"The print was better than I thought and they all fit great, the sizing in comparison to the chart is a little off. I sized up just in case and I'm glad I did, the women's large was definately a junior girls size large and doesn't flow off me like I like and one of the shirts the head hole was a bit smaller than the rest but that's about all. The images were perfect and they looked a little vintage like I like. So happy I took the chance and ordered. Will definately be ordering more in the future.",1
This is the place where I buy my tshirts. Thank you,0
My most recent order is really poor quality compared to previous orders. The logo is blurry on both sides and cut off at the bottom on the back.,3
I got my correct order in a timely fashion and the product was all high quality ����,6
Product was far below satisfactory in quality.,3
Not very happy with the quality. The picture on the t-shirt and hoodie I ordered looked like it was stretched out to fit onto the t-shirt and hoodie and is very pixellated and blurry. It's hard to even make-out the wording and characters on the shirt. Disappointed.,3
"Great design, except the shirt I was sent has one shoulder visibility wider than the other and the graphic is SO FAR OFF-CENTER that I noticed it as soon as I unfolded my shirt!So incredibly disappointing... unless the shirt can be exchanged for free - will not recommend this company or use them ever, again.",3
"Hi!The details of the print are excellent, quality of the shirt is great and the fit is right-on! Hard to find t-shirts that fit the way as advertised. Thank you for your attention to quality.

The t-shirts fits very well and the service is amazing. Thank you !,0
Great quality shirt and came within a week THANK YOU ����,0
"I LOVE the message on the masks and banner.However, the masks need to have the metal piece to fold over the bridge of your nose.Without it, the mask rides up and the material pokes you in the eyes.Also without the nose piece you do not get a tight fit for safety purposes to prevent spreading or receiving the virus.The banner is beautiful, but the lettering is off center.There is 11��������� from the left border and 7��������� from the right border.Also there are two small white triangles sporadically place on the right side of the lettering, like corners for guides on a screen perhaps.As I said above, I am very pleased with the message the banner and masks are displaying, but I am disappointed",3
"I absolutely LOVE the shirt I ordered! I was a little concerned about the fit, so I ordered a size up. But I'd say they run true to size (I don't mind a little extra room, so it's okay.) The design print is a bit larger than I expected, but that's not a bad thing. Thank you for a great product and awesome shipping time!",0
This is my first purchase with TeePublic and I have no complaints. The t-shirt was of nice quality and the customer service was just right. I will definitely use them again.,6
Two stars!! I hate giving negative reviews but the quality of 2 out of 4 shirts was terrible. A kids xs image was very fuzzy and located in the bottom half of the shirt. The adult m I bought for myself I was also very disappointed.There is ZERO crispness to the image. It looks like an iron on. I will not be buying from teepublic again.,3
"Fast, quick, quality work! Thank you!!",0

I don���������t like the quality of the shirt �����������,4
"The graphic looked faded on a nice bright red shirt.I should have chosen the blue so it would���������ve looked more blended. The lettering was not bright white which may have been because of the red. It just looked like a cheap iron on I would craft myself at home. I also felt the graphic was also too high on the shirtThe shirt quality was nice, but overall I was really dissapointed when I opened the package. My sister was with me and said wow thats not what you expected",3

I'm happy with my new T-shirt; the print is quality. I would recommend!,1
"Using Covid-19 is not an excuse for poor customer service. While we understand that delays have been occurring on getting merchandise shipped, the lack of communication around such shipping issues was more concerning. After an initial email that said the order was received, it took them more than a month before they finally acknowledged that they had a problem with my order, and only after I reached out to them to ask where the order was. If the company knew that such issues were occurring, they should have done a better job at pro-actively notifying customers and allowing them to seek alternatives. Instead, an order that was meant to be a birthday gift was not delivered on time, disappointing my son.",3
"Super cute, get color and perfect size, thanks for the hard work.",0

I went to change it, but I could only remove or add extra items of the same products, I already had in my cart, so I had to make an other order (which I didn't) and here comes the second suggestion.. Please lower the shipping cost.. Maybe it's not up to you entirely, but I assure you that with the products you have and a better shipping price you would have way more sales!Thank you for the time you spent reading this",0

I ordered a few shirts for Christmas gifts and one of them was going to be too small plus the graphic didn't show up on the shirt as it showed on the website. The colors were too close. I reached out to customer service and asked if I could do an exchange to have the shirt remade in a different color and they immediately responded that they would remake the shirt free of charge and to keep the old one. We often have shirts made for our Disney trips and we are stopped quite often by people asking about them. We will be sure to tell them that TeePublic is awesome to work with.Thank you again!!,0

I have ordered face masks through teepublic before the holiday and the three masks that I ordered came in as dual layered with stretchable ear pieces.

"TeePublic was very helpful in replacing my package multiple times when the delivery kept failing. I am very satisfied with the resolution of customer issue! Thank you, TeePublic!",0
"So I have ordered a couple of shirts and so far it's been amazing. Only shirt I had an issue with but got it fixed real fast and easy was when I purchased a hocus pocus shirt in women's, well they run a little smaller so it was too small for my gf, I emailed and they said I can keep the original and get it replaced with no charge so now both my gf and daughter get to match. Thank you so much on the awesome designs and amazing shirts.",0
The tracking updates are very regular and accurate. Item received in good condition and reasonable lead time. Will definitely order again when there is another free shipping offer !,6
Tee Public is an amazing company who really cares about their customers. My experience was nothing short of perfect!They need to sell a shirt that says Support Tee Public!!!Thanks Tee Public,0
"It took a long time to receive order, but i,m o.k with that. I'm very disappointed with the tee shirts. I ordered one shirt to be a female scoop neck, long sleeve, and received a male short sleeve. That's a pretty big mistake. I wanted to reach out to TeePublic, but was no phone number given,and no category for their error.I would be happy to change my rating if TeePublic would like to make this right.",3
Thank you very much for fast service and great tee����,0
Customer Services is on point. I had a small dilemma and it was resolved with complete satisfaction. Thank you Tee Public,0
I love my buttons! Thanks!,0
Love the designs but the shirts are super small. Orders two women's 2x and they sent me a child's size.������������ Was really disappointed and they can't be returned and they don't have a bigger size options for the shirt (type).������������ It sucks that any plus size women who would like a shirt will have to wear a men's size. ������������Warning: if you see a note that says people like to order a size bigger its b,3

"I am pretty disappointed with the sweatshirt I received. It is poorly made, it wasn't black, but some faded dark brown. The size is way off. I ordered a 3xl and couldn't even get it on. It fits my son perfectly who wears a men's small. The hood tie string didn't have any aglets on it and was frayed. The graphic was poorly applied and bubbled on the hoodie and t-shirts. The color of the graphics did not match the site at all and were very faded.Shipping took a very long time.",3

Incredible service. I will pass on the good word about your company.Thank you,0
"My order experience was perfect! My products were what I ordered and exactly like the description. Both of my items were band logos and they were spot on! I was kept informed through the entire process. And shipping was super fast. The hoodie I purchased was a little more bulky in the arms/arm pit area than I had hoped for, I wasn't sure what the brand was. But that issue was the manufacturer of the shirt itself, not the artist. I am super happy with my items. I would definitely recommend and I will be purchasing again in the future! Thank you!",0
"Thank you so much for providing great products! I also thank all of the artisans for the awesome designs! I thoroughly enjoy all of the shirts that I have purchased (35 so far), with several of them being given as gifts to friends. Each one brings with it a fun and fond memory, from the Kaiju Gojira, to the Devastator Transformer, to the Black Beard's Morale Improvement Beatings. I would like to add that the t-shirts are very well made, using top quality material. They are super soft, look great and are sold at a good price. I have shared TeePublic.com with a good number of my friends and colleagues, telling them this is the place to go if you want some really cool and unique t-shirts, and that there are thousands of designs to choose from. I will definitely keep coming back for more shirts, as long as you all keep providing them for us.Again, thank you so very much! ~LR",0
Tees are great! I would buy more if my wife would let me!!! Thanks,0
The tee is of decent quality but it is long and the graphic stamp is crooked. There was no QC here and I won't ever use this service again.,4

"I love the show supernatural and was so excited to order two long-sleeve tees, when they arrived however, I was disappointed. The print job was terrible, and everything was blurry.

I enjoy the quality of the shirt fabric that I received the quality of the printed image on shirt could be better but since this was the first time I have order from TeePublic it could just be the image for this particular shirt.,1

"Really nice women's style t-shirt and great service!Because this style t-shirt usually runs small I ordered a size larger than normal. It was still too small and I contacted TeePublic about exchanging it for a larger size. They wrote back immediately to tell me they were sending a larger size AND that I could keep the other t-shirt for myself or to give it away. Wow! Never heard of a company doing that before! The larger t-shirt arrived about a week later in time for Christmas too! Thank you, TeePublic!

Great custom product. Fast delivery. Exactly as described. Would recommend. Thanks!,0
"Very helpful in resolving size problem. I will definitely order from this site again. My only recommendation is maybe include one or two more models when looking at sizes. It's awesome that there is such a diverse range of models, but at 5'11"" and 200 lb, I think my size is pretty generic. I was surprised that none of the models were very close to that. But now I know to order a size up. Thanks!",0

I've found some unique comic book shirts on TeePublic.The quality has been good so far.They also have the option for the customer to select different background colors for the shirts which is a nice feature.I guess the only disappointment I have is the following shirt is no longer available.They should probably keep all their designs on file forever and print the shirts on demand.Vintage Retro Bronze Age Avengers Cover Thanos Endgame sold by Osprey,3

Half of my order is what I expected but the other half of the shirts are giant! I ordered female classic cut and all look good but they grey ones are just regular Gildan t shirts. No tailored cut to them whatever so ever. Disappointing because my child is going to be swimming in these.I know they won't exchange. I have ordered plenty of grey shirts before and never got these crappy ones ever!,3

UPS 'said'it was left by the front door..probably in full view of the public I imagine. I assume it was stolen. I emailed TeePublic in anger and explained what had happened.Without hesitation TeePublic arranged to ship a replacement and absorbed all costs incl shipping. Amazing ! Their response was prompt and professional and their staff courteous and customer focused. Definitely earned my admiration and loyalty. I will return for more shopping and I strongly suggest to visit their website and shop with confidence knowing that TeePublic provide an excellent customer and after sales service. They turned a disappointing event into a positive lasting experience. Thank you !,0

The t-shirt is badly printed. It looks blurry and not enough ink has been applied. Very disappointed.,3

Great item! Thanks my bf loves it!,0
I ask for 3x I got a medium shirt I'm very upset it's Friday the gender reveal is Sunday there's no way I can wear this shirt too small,3
The colors red and white Santa Clause hat should never be painted with brown and gray.There is no lot variation of white that should end up with gray.The same with bright red should never turn out to be brown.This company has a very poor quality expectation for itself.I would never order from this company again.,4
My wife is very happy with the tee that I purchased for her.I will pay a little more for a better quality and unique tee versus adding to a corporations bottom line.,1
The print was well done but the t shirt has a whole in it on the sleeve. It���������s disappointing considering it��,3
"The quality of the actual hoodie was really good, but the image was quite small even factoring in the sweater pocket. When it says the image size will adjust from the photo, it means by ALOT. I would maybe suggest for them to alter their website photos to already 'factor in' the image placement for the pocket to get a more accurate example of what you are purchasing for like $80 CAD. Was a little disappointed but my husband will probably still love it so it was still a win in the end",3
"The MARCELINE'S ROCK SHIRT FOR PB shirt looks great, it was printed well and the details showed in the design are perfect, however, the POSE | Giorno Giovanna shirt was not printed as well as the other shirt. It looks like the printer was starting to run out of ink or something because I can see there are little white lines in the design when I look at it. I am slightly disappointed by this considering I paid roughly 20 dollars for the shirt so I expected good quality print wise.",3
T shirt didn't arrive as shown in picture. THEY CORRECTED THIS ISSUE AT NO EXTRA COST! Thankyou soooo much!!,0
"Disappointed, I have not received my product. I ordered back in May.I have reached out to notify TeePublic that it was not received, despite the shipping/tracking notice. With still no response other than they are inundated with emails currently. I had special ordered these items as a gift and now am out over $60, with no response or help to get the order figured out.",3
My shirt I bought fits very well and I am very happy with it,1
"Very disappointed!the sizes that I received look more like for a child not an adult woman.I was going to give one as a retirement gift. sure can't as I know it will not fit her.I have not researched their return policy, but I am sure it will cost me to send back, not happy.",3
Colors don't look right. Looks like a cheap knock off.,4
"My one of my designs disappear every time I upload it, and I had upload it about 6 or 8 times. I Have requested help to solve this issue, but until now, I haven't received any good answer.Also, the number of product selled in my store does not reflect the real number of sales, and I know this because I have bought some of them just to see if their appear in the count of sales. This makes me to lose confidence on the transparency on the website.",3
"The designs on the shirts were very cute. My husband and I thought they were very unique. Although, the men's small is a bit smaller than other men's small I've ordered. I'm worried that I may need a men's medium based on how the small fits already.I am updating my review today because of the loyalty TeePublic has to its customers. After reading my review, they responded and assisted me right away to ensure I received what I was looking for all the while providing quality customer service. They went out of their way (above and beyond, I tell yah) for me, just to make sure I was a satisfied customer. And after all that, YES, I am very much satisfied.Thank you TeePublic! :)",0
It was great ! Thank you!,0
"My order arrived in a timely manner, and the T-Shirt itself feels like great quality and feels super comfortable.My only upset is the colour on the shirt. I ordered the Dallas Stars Neon Alternate logo tshirt. The green logo is not as neon and vibrant as advertised and viewed on the website, it's more of a darker green. Disappointed with that.",3

I ordered 2 hoodies one looked great and the other did not print well. I reached out and they fixed it by reprinting it. I got the reprinted hoodie and it looks great. Thanks for fixing this for me.,0
Tee shirt looks great.Thank you.,0
"While the design and color of each of the two t shirts I ordered was very nice, the quality of the t shirts themselves was very poor.One shirt had an incorrectly sewn seam with an open hole and the other after the first washing developed small holes in the fabric.I am very disappointed, not in the artwork, but in the fabric and construction of the shirts.I noticed they were made in Nicaragua which is very distressing to me.I have personally seen Nicaraguan Zona Franca (CAFTA ""free trade"") factory complexes in which this type of clothing is made and they are set up for worker abuse without protections of workers' rights.It is distressing that your support of independent artists includes clothing made under such conditions in a country that clearly violates human rights.",3

Cute t-shirt but the iron-on image was not crisp and clean. The image was light and had a lot of spots where the iron-on didn't transfer completely. The t-shirt underneath was showing.

Exactly what I ordered. Shipped quickly and safely.,6
"The customer Service person was friendly and understanding.Although I did handle my request through a ""Chat"", my preference would have been to actually speak with the representative via telephone.Online chat is not nearly as effective, in my opinion, as a call.I regularly avoid companies where the only means to reach them is via online chat.Because this was an exchange , I followed your procedure and worked through the online chat.I would like to give Kudos to the customer service rep I spoke with!I am sure you can look up her name.Thank you.",0

Fast delivery. Order was correct,6
"Tax and shipping were kinda pricey from FL to NC. Just got my T-shirt & hoodie... Was pleased that they fit and the quality of the fabric was okay. However, my disappointment was in the logos... They were dull and kinda dingy looking. The colors were not as vibrant as they were when advertised on the site. All in all, I spent 63 bucks for 1 tee and 1 hoodie during a supposed sale... Won't do that again.",3
Took a little while to make it all the way to Australia but I anticipated that and the wait was worth it. Good quality and great print. Thanks,0
I understand things happen but I was disappointed in a sweatshirt I ordered. The decal ran across the top of the decal with white paint decal and they still shipped it instead of reprinting and making a new one. I have asked for a refund.,3
"Shirt fits well and print is crisp, however a tad thinner than I would like for the price. Still happy to have purchased!",1
The designs let ok even better in person. I am so happy with the print. The size of the shirts aren't to bad but would augg at going 1 size bigger if you are like me and like the baggy looking style.,1

I knew even though he liked the one I ordered, he was somewhat disappointed because it was too snug.When I contacted your company with my issue, you offered to replace it with a larger sized at no cost, not even shipping. I have never had that type of service extended to me anywhere. You guys are amazing and make it worth it and pleasant to order from your company.

"I have bought two orders from here. The first order was awesome, shirts were high quality prints were great. I just got my second order and I have to say I am super disappointed, the prints are all really thin you can see vertical lines on all the prints it really makes them look super cheap. I guess it's hit or miss. They are great with shipping. So just a heads up.",3

Found you guys off Pinterest and its exactly what I was looking for.I wanted to surprise my husband with the supra merchandise to match his car for his birthday. It didn't come on time but he was happy with it overall and thats all that matters. So thank you!,0
"Shirts were easy to order, with fun designs. I was pretty disappointed to get an email before Christmas that they wouldn't arrive on time even though I had ordered pretty early. Shirts actually did arrive a couple days before Christmas after all, so that worked out ok. Print is good, but the colors faded a little after only one wash. Sizes run super small. I bought these as jammies so I thought I was being generous when as a sz 22 woman I ordered a 3xl women's shirt. The shirt fits me very snug, like maybe a unisex XL normally does. All in all, not a terrible experience. I might order from them again, but it will depend on how the print on these wears. I would definitely order bigger. Really disappointed in the sizing and I used to run a screen print shop so I am familiar with how sizing works.",3
The time it takes to get the product compared to other T-Shirt vendors is too long. Unfortunately I will not use the site again due to the lag in shipment. It took a month to received my item and I ordered a similar t-shirt from a competitor and receive it in 6 days (standard shipment). The product once received was true to size and graphic was as it looks just on a positive side.,3
I am very satisfied with my order ��������������������������������������,6

"Delivery took about a month which was communicated clearly. There was an issue with the post office where they received it at my local post office but took a week to actually deliver it. Customer support with TeePublic took longer than anticipated to email back but that was also communicated so it was not a surprise. Overall, customer support was as prompt as they could be due to volume and successfully answered questions. Order came and it was a great design/fit. Only issue was with the post office which is not TeePublic's fault. Thank you for the order!",0

The sexism inherent in the fast-fashion industry is definitely here. Women's shirts are priced higher and very small - I previously ordered a unisex medium and a large women's classic and the large women's was definitely smaller than the unisex. So I ordered again a unisex medium and a XL women's and it was still smaller than the unisex. Frustrating because I need the bottom of the shirt to flare slightly to fit my hips. I do love the designs and supporting my favorite podcasters. I'm just disappointed.,3

The quality is good. And my ""Better Things Are Possible"" shirt is on its way to becoming one of my favorites. Thanks, Tee Public!",0
One of the shirts was printed with the sellers water mark still on the image. Disappointing.,3
Great as expected. Thanks,0
"While the design is adorable, I am very disappointed that it did not hold up after one laundering. All 4 shirts lettering faded and theare cracking. I was hoping for more than one wearing. The quality is that of an iron on transfer rather than screen printing.",3
Love all the different selections!!Thank you!,0
"These T's are excellent ! Glad I chooseheavyweight fabric, should last for years. I'm 5'10"" tall 190 and the large fits perfectly. Art work my style, love it,thank you. ����",0

I enjoyed all my shirts... With the acceptance of one... Wasn't as happy as I thought it appeared in the image... But I did like all my other shirts. Waiting for the next sale to place another order.,1
I thought the choices were beyond impressive.I was just a little disappointed with the coloring of some of the designs.Particularly the ones that had red on them.Almost looked pink.,3
I loved both shirts we ordered.Thank you for doing such a great job.,0
"Exactly what I wanted, great packaging! Thanks Teepublic!",0
"I received the wrong hoodie (color and style) and despite emailing 3 days ago, there has been no follow-up.",3
Was happy with everything would order again,1
The t-shirt quality was good. The quality of the transfer/decal was VERY disappointing. I will probably NOT order again. I really believe that #garyvee #teamgaryvee would be disappointed with the quality too.,3

Looks just as advertised and arrived quickly.,6
"The shirts arrived sooner than I expected and the email notification of their delivery was much appreciated. The quality of the tee shirts is good. The prints are clear. The only drawback at this point is that a couple seem to have the print slightly skewed. Regardless they are just what I was hoping to find. The color selection was quite nice, though it would have been nice to have a few more color selections for the ladies. These will be gifts (and we are keeping 2) for a group of friends who are getting together to play D and D over 3 or 4 days for the first time in 40 years. We are an original group who worked from the rules set out as articles in a gaming magazine, some time before the first manuals were printed. I have no idea how the shirtswill wash but will instruct folks to turn inside out, wash in cold water on gentle cycle and hang to dry to reduce shrinkage. Thank you and I am tickled I found your site. You seem to hit many of the environmental, socially conscious and artistic ideals we try to subscribe to.",0

Ordered a month before Christmas for my son. Just got here after new years.Like what came. Thanks. Need discounts for that and we could be tight.,0
"I have yet to receive my package, But I was super excited with how customisable the options are, I hardly see it anywhere else. The promotion of independent artist is also super important to me, I have already recommended it to my friends. Also because I am so ambiguously queer its sometimes hard to find shirts i can relate too but by promoting independent artist the range and broadness of your selection really makes it worth wild. I will probs be ordering more shirts for my bffs in the future. Thank you for the open and outward thinking you guys rock!",0

"This is by far the worse shirt I ever gotten online.Picture on the website wasn't what I got.I got what looks like a faded unfinished print of Sugoi.From what I gathered, it was supposed to look like a satirical print of the brand Supreme, but instead of Supreme it would say Sugoi.I was excited to buy this shirt to my friend who's Japanese.I had to keep the shirt for myself coz I wasn't about to give him a shirt that looks like was bought from a thrift store.This is not a knock on anyone, and I'm not looking for a refund, I just hope this was due to the pandemic that you had to sell a subpar value.Please don't do this to any of your customers.Thank you.",0
"Not a bad shirt, just has a different feel. Made in Nicaragua, has very thin, loose, fine weave. Thin neckline. I'm used to Carhartt, Hanes, Fruit of Loom, Gildan etc.But hey, $13 with custom imprint.Years ago, I worked at a fine men's store. Sold upscale suits, shirts, clothing to upscale professional community. Interesting to learn piece goods, cut, quality etc.Thank you for inquiry. You have an amazing customer service team. Overall, well done.Take care and good day. Dennis",0

I couldn't give 5 stars as I would have preferred a nicer material like the rung spun cotton. That being said I am very happy with my order. Thank you!,0
I recently purchased a t-shirt and I couldn't be happier with my purchase! The quality of the fabric is top-notch and the fit is perfect. The colors are vibrant and the design looks even better in person. I've worn it several times already and it's held up really well after washing. I highly recommend this t-shirt to anyone who wants to add a stylish and comfortable piece to their wardrobe. Thank you for creating such a great product!,0
I've bought shirts on more than 1 occasion from y'all. My girlfriend bought me a shirt from y'all that Im not thrilled about. The writing has started to come off after washing it once. That's disappointing,3

"First time ordering. We wanted a gift for my nephew and have not been disappointed. The item was just like the picture, the quality was great.

"Tee Public's customer service was great but the product I ordered had issues. First, the long sleeve tee is not soft or giving. It's scratchy and stiff. Second, the ""1776"" that was to be on my shirt was a dull blue gray, not white as ordered. They kindly replaced it--unfortunately with one of the very same kind. So I still don't have what I ordered.",3

"Very disappointed in the quality of the pleated masks, especially at the cost.Print quality: Direct-to-garment printing as I expected but the result was a faded looking mask fresh out of the package. Print image was a bit off centered but even if it weren't the design doesn't work on a mask (in this case, 'Spaceballs' is visible and 'The Mask' is hidden under my chin) without accounting for how it shapes.Mask quality: Poor fit (no nose wire, loose even on my large face), feels and looks cheap.",3

"Three stars for the shirt. Only three stars for the service.I ordered one shirt by an artist I've followed for years. TeePublic sent me a totally different shirt, in the wrong size, meant for someone two states away. Of course, I contacted their support. The first response blamed their fulfillment center and read like they just wanted me to go away.Then a second person contacted me, acted in a professional manner, and took responsibility. Like the first person should have. They sent out a new shirt, which was correct when it arrived.I'll continue to support the artist. This wasn't their fault. TeePublic though? Yeah, I'll look elsewhere from now on.",6

I enjoy shirts that have cool or funny designs or phrases that make other people smile or laugh.I often get the ""cool shirt"" comments when out and about.Lastly, due to cancer reasons,I have gained a lot of weight in the past year, so finding shirts for my current size is remarkable, comforting and very pleasing.I am a happy camper for sure.",1

"I���������ve purchased quite a lot of items from here. All of the hoodies and tshirts I���������ve purchased are amazing quality. Very durable and withstand lots trips in the washing machine! Always come out looking great !I���������ve ordered the same hoodie twice by mistake. I contacted them and they were very prompt to answer my questions and concerns. They absolutely went above and beyond! As my items arrived later then anticipated, they gave me 100% refund and actually let me keep the hoodie!Now , you tell me that isn���������t customer service at its finest!I will most definitely keep shopping here!Thanks",0
The item was exactly what was advertised.I received it in a timely fashion.,6
Items came a lot faster than I expected.Thank you!!,0
This is annoyingThis type of thing could become very annoying to buyers if being asked all the time and being reminded when not ansering you first review request.,5
I was disappointed in the printing - the dark gray became a blue. Custom sink printed the same image with faithful color reproduction.,3
"Very happy with the two T-shirts I ordered, good quality. Thanks!",0
"My husband saw the tee, ""OLDOMETER 59-60"" advertised on FaceBook. He tagged me saying ""Hint, hint!"" not thinking I'd really order it for him. Two weeks later I gave it to him. He was happily surprised and loves the material. Thank you!",0
"The ordering and delivery were fine, but I am very disappointed in the quality of the print. The cat is supposed to be black but it���������s a dingy black almost dark grey. No time to get another on",3
Great products! Met expectations and delivered within promised timeframe. Thank you,0
"I've ordered a few times from this site. I really appreciate the sizing examples, they were very helpful. All products were just as the description and images. Great prices and reasonable delivery time. Thank you!",0
"Thankyou Teepublic, t-shirts are amazing !",0
"The t-shirt itself was average quality, but the silk screened emblem was very faded. I expected the colors to be bright, as they were in the picture on the sight. I would suggest the t-shirt was worn or used due to the condition of the emblem, but the actual t-shirt felt new.This is a gift. I will give it to the person for whom I bought it, but will include the return label in case they want to return it.I could have made a better t-shirt using my computer and iron on transfers. It would have been cheaper, too.I do not recommend this product.",4
Took care of my lost order and we appreciate the reorder and we received them thanks,0
Quick shipping and looked just how the picture was! I recommend this site to everyone now :),6
I am so very happy with my shirts. I bought 3 tees. All 3 were great quality. ( I was very pleased the t-shirt brand was Gildan). I recommended this to several family members and two has already ordered shirts. Thank you!,0
"Very disappointed! I ordered a baseball type tshirt white with red sleeves and ""In a world full of grinches be a Cindy Lou Who!"" on it. I bragged to my daughter-in-law how perfect it was for her. The day came it arrived I grabbed it out of the mailbox and rushed it over to her without opening it. I proudly handed the package to her, she ripped it open and pulled out the ugliest long sleeve dingy dark gray long sleeve tshirt with the correctsaying on it amazingly but faded so you had to get right up close to read the words on it. Did not scream happy holidays at all, more like a Christmas nightmare. It's one of those unrepairable moments.",3
"Thank you for the great shirts.I am totally please with the size, quality and delivery speeds. Definitely a trustworthy vendor.",0
Color is great. Image on the shirt is great. I ordered a 3xl because my boyfriend is very tall. The shirt is 3xl WIDE not in length. Very disappointed this shirt will probably never get worn because the length is so short and now I have to rush to find another shirt before father's day.,3
"I really liked the first two tees I bought from you but the one I was most excited about was the disappointing one!The city of Bordeaux sweatshirt was a great picture but when it arrived it looked pretty amateurish!I realize that it's difficult to print a photo on a black shirt, but this seemed like something I could have done myself with teeshirt transfer paper for dark surfaces.",3
The shirt is high quality and would buy another. Thanks!,0
So happy with the design of the t-shirts I have ordered and plain to purchase more of the great design's in the near future. There are so many to chose from and I know so many people to whom the shirts will relate to. many Christmas presents this year. thank you so much thank you to all the artiest GREAT WORK!!!!!!!,0

"Hello, I recently bought a couple of shirts from the website. I am pleased to say I am happy with my shirts!! But, I would love it if some designs could be bigger on the shirts and also having some sort of design printed on the back. Thank you!",0
I am grateful TeePublic sent a larger size at no additional cost and encouraged me donate the shirt that didn't fit. Excellent costumers service. The shirt quality was also on point.,0

"I thought colors of the paintings could be a little brighter.The meaning of the phrases are deep and emotional, I love it! And service was superb! Thank you!",0
We ordered a Halsey shirt for our daughter for Christmas. I was so excited about this product until I received and opened it. The screen print is so dark that you can't even tell who it is supposed to be. We were so disappointed in it that we did not even gift it to our daughter. It got thrown in the pile of old shirts to use for art projects. The actual tshirt quality was horrendous as well. It is a black tshirt and I can see right through it when I hold it up. Very disappointed!,3
"Thanks for asking for my feedback; I have to tell you that the printing quality is great; the material also great --the only thing I was not fond of -and probably very important, is the cut of the tee shirt and the finishing so I love the color and the printing but I may only wear it around the house.Thank you.Brenda Haverly, 3146802536",0

Your Customer Service team was excellent. They were very kind in notifying me that my package could not deliver due to no such address. It was missing the PO Box number I needed to include. They re-shipped it and it arrived safely. That was really nice and my Grandson loved both his sweatshirt and T-shirt. Thank you!!,0
"The shirts I ordered are great, they arrived quickly the order was correct - my only complaint which is why i gave it 4/5 and not 5 is when I was placing my order it just said ""tank top"" as an option which is fine - but there are different styles of tank tops so the shoulders on the tank tops I received were weirdly thin almost like spaghetti straps that women wear, they are thicker than that but not much more so it took a bit of getting used to.Overall good product - just disappointed by not knowing what I was getting",3
I ordered two T-shirts. They were mediocre in quality. The shirt material was thin. And while the logo looks good it has already started to peel.Thank you,0
"Tons of pictures to choose from and many options to have the images placed on is what brought me to your company. Also, I was very happy with the tapestries I received. The Images look great.",1

"Nice shirt , thanks for keeping it real .",0
Got just what I ordered and needed Very happy with Q shirt,1
"I like the product once my order finally arrived! My 3 rating has absolutely nothing to do with the artists. If the artists product doesn���������t arrive in a timely manner, it reflects negatively regardless of whose fault it is. My order was placed in the beginning of May. Wasn���������t shipped until June. Then because you switch mail carriers, my order arrived at my local post office and was then routed to North Carolina. It���������s a shame that you are not able to figure out a smoother process for shipping",3

Shipping costs are way to expensive! I thought the parcel was shipped from america and therefore accepted the high shipping cost.

Great design great shirt thank you TeePublic,0
"Seriously, this is the ONLY place I buy shirts, masks, whatever y'all sell, from anymore. Every other clothing outlet is boring and sucks big-time and this is the PERFECT way for me to express myself while also supporting up and coming small creators. I need TeePublic to look back thru my order history and give smootches to all the people I ordered from thanks! Btw, idk my order date, I've ordered so many times just take a guess",0

"I purchased a mask that was a really cool logo however, the quality was so poor I feel that it may not protect me. I love to support the band but for the price and price of shipping, a quality product should have arrived. a real shame!

I know times are hard, but you are just taking advantage of people now.We are all on the struggle bus, disappointed!",3
"I was disappointed in the poor quality of this shirt, that I bought in a size 4T for my little grandson. As soon as I opened the package I noticed the image of the four characters was blurry and the overall print seemed dull. The material feels course, not the quality I want my grandson to wear against his skin.",3
The work and product is exceptional and working with TeePublic has been a pleasure. Have shared my experience with friends and family. Thank so much!,0
Everything came just as ordered. I love the shirts. Thanks so much!,0

Cool shirts. I have ordered over 10 and have no complaints.Fun to shop around on the site and see designs you will see no where else. All kinds of cool '80s stuff.,1
My first order came on time. When my second order was a couple weeks late (it was during the holidays so I'm pretty sure it just got lost in all the holiday packages at the post office or sorting center) I contacted the company and they immediately reshipped my order and it came on time. The t-shirts were quality material and fit perfectly. Will definitely purchase from this company again and recommend it to friends and family.,6

"I ordered four masks for my family. The selection was great. We were each able to pick out a print that appealed to our own likes. The quality of the masks are great. If you have a smaller face they do run a bit big, but you can easily knot the strings that go behind your ears for a closer fit. My husband and sons had no problems with the fit of their masks. Once shipped they all arrived within the timeline that was estimated. I would definitely recommend TeePulic to my family and friends based off my experience. It was a pleasant experience from beginning to end. Thank you!:)",0

Ordered 2 of the same shirt in 2 different sizes. Both shirts I received were defective. Both images were crooked and off center. Very noticeably. Not even work shirt worthy. I contacted support and was sent a replacement within 24 hours. Which was great. But unfortunately the replacements were also defective. Possibly even worse. I again contacted support and was refunded money. Pretty disappointing.,3
"I wanted to purchase a ""Pokey & Gumby"" shirt for my wife (long story), so when I found one on TeePublic I ordered it immediately. Now, my wife usually wears a size Medium, once in a while a Small; so, I ordered Medium. When it arrived, it fit her like a pretty SMALL ""Small"" - I could see it was uncomfortable for her. She insisted I do NOT return it, it's the thought that counts, etc., etc. But I contacted TeePublic anyway. WOW! I just received an email confirming that another shirt has been delivered in the larger size I'd requested! WHAT?! A company that sells gorgeous stuff AND cares? I'm blown away, and tell EVERYONE about this site. Thank you, Thank You, THANK YOU!!!",0

The images on the T-shirts are not clear and smudged. I have ordered from you plenty of times and never had this. It looks like someone took the image and expanded it beyond the size it could be stretch. One of the shirts I cannot even make out the character. Extremely disappointed ������,3

"There are a ton of design options available, and I appreciate the ability to support independent artists, however, customer service was disappointing. I was really excited to receive my order. However, my order took a really long time to ship, and I received very few updates regarding the status of my order. When the order did ship, I never received my package, even though it had been marked as delivered. I tried to work with UPS to locate the package and file a claim, however, due to the method of shipping I was unable to file a claim and UPS was unable to help me because I was not the shipper of the package. I then reached out to try to get assistance from TeePublic, but when I did so, I received a notification that I would get a response within 7 days. I feel like by that time it will be completely impossible to find my package, and I will be out of options. I understand that times are difficult with COVID, however, more communication and a little urgency would have been appreciated. At this point I am still awaiting resolution of the problem, but have no idea how it will be resolved.",3

THEN after searching the page there was absolutely no indication that it would be smaller than most journals. Its saysNOTEBOOK. Not Journal. It's a father's day gift so I'll make do, and otherwise, the quality meets expectations. PLEASE UPDATE DESCRIPTION AS NOT TO DUPE YOUR CUSTOMERS.",3

I was in a Nashville for a very short time and was unable to get out and about to find some souvenirs for my grand kids before heading home. So when I got home we set about trying to find some on line. Your designs were the most appealing and varied. Plus we liked the local artists aspect. You had what we wanted at reasonable prices and the shirts came when promised. The shirts are good quality and look great. We see the grands today and we���������ll have a bag of great shirts with us. We will keep you in our address book for future use. Thanks for a great experienc,0

I typed into Google what I wanted and the site came up so decided to give them a try. Website was easy to find what I was looking for. I ordered 3 tshirts and they came when they said they would. On time. I wasnt expecting them to quickly with how Covid is effecting everyone. I got the right sizes and went with the size chart on the website. Everything fits! Will use them again! Thanks!,0
"UPDATE - RESOLUTIONAfter submitting a product issue with pictures on their website, they reprinted the shirts. I have received and washed the new shirts, exactly as I did the first ones and they are better.One of the shirts looks like it will have the same issue after a few more washes, but we have decided that we will wash it separate from anything else and not put it in the dryer at all.I am satisfied with the resolution.ORIGINAL POST The designs are fantastic, but the shirt print quality is no good. I washed my shirts in cold water with a small amount of detergent and put them in the dryer ona low heat setting. Every one of them has paint peeling or partial images smudged or removed. They won't last through many washings. I'm so disappointed and frustrated.UPDATE - Response to TeePublicI submitted my information and pictures on Saturday afternoon. Your page says responses are usually within 24 to 48 hrs, I'm not sure if that includes Saturday and Sunday.I did not receive any confirmation that my information was received, so I will resubmit everything if I have not heard back by Tuesday.",3
Honestly the shipping and order process was smooth. This was my first time ordering from you guys. It was actually just the quality I was disappointed in.

"ok, the green and bluish shirts were good/okay to read the ""Helen.....etc"" however, the pink one was barely visible and a big disappointment.You need to use a darker ink or whatever.....if I had time I would have maybe sent the pink one back, but it would have been to much of a hassle.Sorry, but you need to improve the visibility of the Wording on Shirt....color of the cotton shirt is good it is the printing.Thank you, Good Luck, hope this helps you look at the product's printing....Marian Moore",0
I don't like the sizing chart for kids. I do appreciate an easy to use site and speedy response to my request for an exchange! Thank you!,0

"The sweater I got looked super good on the website but when I got it, it was a bit underwhelming. It was obviously just an iron on icon on a black crew neck sweater, even though the $30-$40 price led me to expect more.",3

This site is very reasonable with prices.I paid a little extra to get the soft higher quality cotton.And believe me the shirt is SUPER soft!The fit of the shirt is very flattering and I really enjoyed being able to select a design of a well known artist and change the color of the shirt to fit what would be the most flattering color.They have many different options to get what you want.I love that they are USA based and took only a week for delivery. ������,1

Enjoy the customer service that's been provided. Last package included not just the exchanged item but the other item ordered. The other item wasn't expecting until later,1
"I wanted to order 10 shirts for the holidays with the same design.I ordered 9 by mistake and when I went back to order one more, the design was gone with no way for me to re-order it.So in our group, I will be the only one that does not have a matching shirt.I am really unhappy about it.I would think that there would be a way to print something that I had just ordered 2 weeks ago.Customer service was 0 help and didn't even apologize for the inconvenience.",3
My t shirts came quickly and they were EXACTLY as advertised.Thanks!,0
"Enjoy the fact that there are shirts that match every subject, age, size, and different maturity levels.The fact that you let the artists truly be themselves is what sets you apart from competitors.The biggest factor aside from the above mentioned is that there are so many colors to choose from.It drives me insane to find a shirt on a different site that only offers black, white, grey, dark blue, and dark green.I live in Texas and white shirts are okay, but don't look different from anyone else.The dark colors just suck up heat and we are hot most of the year.Thanks for being there TeePublic.",1
All three orders (did I make more?) went very smoothly. A lot of styles to choose from.,6

Shirts are just like the pictures on the website. Appear to be great quality and are nice and soft. I���������m very happy with my purchase and would buy again. BONUS: got my order delivered on my birthday. ��,1
"I ordered the ""America's As*"" shirt online and when I received it, the design on the shirt was of very poor quality. It was really pixelated. I could have captured the image and made the shirt myself and saved money. I was very disappointed that they would have shipped a shirt that looked that bad after what they charged me for it.",3
I was happy with the shirt. It came as advertised. Good fit.,1

Sizing is way off. Large is like a small. Very dissapointed.,3
Exactly what I ordered. Good quality. And delivered quickly.,6
Thank you for the perfect product,0
"It was such a joy to find the artwork of a favourite artist of mine on their site. Their unique way of showing how their various sizes of T-shirts fit by using real life pictures of male and female models, giving height and weight descriptions, truly took the guesswork out of what size to order. I like my t-shirts to drape loosely and, even after washing, it fit perfectly! The artwork on my shirt takes up a lot of surface area but they applied it in such a way that it doesn't feel like I'm wearing a plastic shield across my chest. It drapes and breathes like fabric and yet the artwork is crisp and detailed. I was so thrilled with the quality and price that I plan to buy a second shirt with the same artwork AND will look for other designs that I want.",1
Wonderful experience!! From ordering to delivery to wearing my Tees non stop since they arrived! Thank you TeePublic and Indy artists!!,0
"Amazing quality and customer service.Love the shirts!!!Needed a different size for one and they immediately sent a replacement, following up several times to make sure it was correct.Yeah, stellar work.Thank you!Will definitely be ordering again.",0
Print quality of the image is poor. Detail is lost and really the image is more of asilhouette.,3
"The buying experience is good, preparation was fast, delivery is what delivery is: not depending on sender.All in all I am a bit disapointing by the quality of the tee shirt, having spent extra dollar for better quality, the thing is super hot and does not breathe much. The logo are great but if you can't wear the shirt what's the point.",3
"First, loved the design. I still have my Little People and HAD to have a shirt. Wearing it right now. Quick delivery. The quality of the shirt is great. Would order again from this company. Thank you!",0

All of our t-shirts were excellent design and qaulity...thank you!,0
I can't fault the efficiency and the artwork but I was a little disappointed with the quality of the hoody. I had hoped it would be softer and warmer.,3
"My order was handled well!! The printing on the shirt was a lighter color then the original I ordered, but nothing I would get in a twist over. I appreciate the rapid response and the customer care! Thank you!",0
"I loved the design of the shirt I purchased, even if it clearly was made up of layered clip art. I did not realize that what I would be receiving is a tee with an iron-on image. It appears as if my shirt's transfer was run through an ink jet printer that either was running low on ink or was print as such a high dpi the inks didn't meet on the transfer paper. It looks faded and somewhat pixilated, The colors are not at all vibrant (tropical Christmas design) and the transfer is sticky. I had to pull it apart out of the package. Disappointed. Will not be purchasing from here again.",3
Very happy with the quality. I'm always a little nervous when ordering online. I'm happy with what I received.,1
"Hight quality t-shirts! I ordered an man's extra large, true to size and didn't even shrink in the dryer! I also ordered a female v-neck and took the advice online to order a size larger and I agree, it fits better. The shirts are soft and the prints are quality as well. I would recommend and order from here again.",6
"I ordered a Jim Morrison shirt, and it somehow got hung up in the mail.All I did was contact TeePublic and they sent me another shirt at their expense.I usually don't experience such outstanding service from an online retailer.You can't go wrong TeePublic!They're totally awesome, and I love my shirt! Thanks, TeePublic!",0
I ordered shirts for Christmas. I got an email it is shipped on Dec 5 with tracking code. It is Dec 19 now. The item still didnt get processed at ups and tracking code doesnt work. No response from company. Very disappointed,3
Very happy with my phone case. Exactly as advertised and the photo on the back is even more clear than I had expected.,1

Had an issue with 2 shirts printed poorly. It has been slow with no real solving of problem yet.,3
I do like it but when I wear it for a little while I feel I'm suffocating. I really like the design on front with my word mimi. The material is nice but for me with difficult breathing it's hard to wear for a long period of time.Thank you,0

"I purchased my ���������Love is not Tourism��������� pins on TeePublic because I had a difficult time finding them anywhere else. Shipping time was average. The items were packed into a small, bubble envelope so they were not damaged. However, for what the product is and how it looks, they were expensive and shipping was very high! The pins are difficult to read. They do not look like the photo because the photo online is very light. The actual product has both a dark background and dark font. It all blends together, so I���������m really disappointed! The only one that looks okay is the red pin I purchased. This one at least has a white font that stands out, even if the ",3

"I purchased a cloth mask (for COVID) that was of the lower half of a characters face. It was obviously not centred. I did not contact the company, not worth it for something this cheap. Now I just flip it inside out and use the white surface. I was disappointed with the quality control.",3
My husband loved it. He has wanted one like this for over a year. Thank you keep up the good/great work.,0
Looks just as I saw in ad. Size fits well. Washed up nicely.,6
"The graphics are really nice on this T-shirt but I am still very disappointed in the quality of the T-shirt itself. For the price I paid, I was expecting a thicker, higher quality material, especially when these are printed to order and considered ""custom made"" and not ""off the rack"". Additionally, because the customer pays for shipping (the price of which is inflated), I really don't feel like I got what I paid for. I will say that the turnaround time for processing my order was far quicker than one of their competitors. I'm still waiting on that order which was ordered at about the same time.",3
"I have been extremely excited and very pleased with ALL of my tshirts that I have purchased from you. I have put out a good word about you to several people. And I'm sure that I will be ordering many more tshirts from you in the future. Very, very talented artist you are! Thank you, Angela Lawson.",0

"Ordered several masks. All fit differently, despite being ""same size"". I am an average sized adult male, and they all fit poorly. Not one size fits all, by far.

Love the design. Hate that it has a smell. Took along time to ship. But overall I like it. Hopefully my man likes his shirt when he gets it for his bday. Thanks,0
The quality of the product is undeniable. The artwork is exceptional. Thank you!!!,0
I absolutely love my shirt. Thank you,0
I find the quality of the shirts is poor.,3
"Fast delivery, a perfect fit and on the first purchase. Thank you very much!",0
Hi since you asked... sorry the shirts I ordered 2... were thin small to size and frankly a disappointment... and in addition it took over a monthto receive them after I ordered them. Two small skimpy shirts that took a wagon train to travel to me for 50 plus $ ???? Not a satisfactory order for me.,3
Exactly what I ordered and expected.Arrived quickly. No complaints,6
"I ordered a t-shirt about 4 months ago, and about 1 month ago I noticed that the graphic/logo on it is already flaking off. I think I have worn and washed it, with a pretty soft detergent, no more than 8 times since purchasing it.While the fit and feel of the shirt is great, having the logo come off so soon is disappointing :/.",3
I ordered 7 tees for Christmas. They all came on time. And the quality of the Tees and graphics on them are great. I will be ordering more from TeePublic. Thank you!,0
"The service was very good, delivery time also excellent. My problem was my disappointment in the mug I ordered. It was to be a gift for a psychiatrist I work for..some humor..but I missed or never saw the sizeof the mug��������� I don���������t think the dimensions were in the listing���������it���������s small and noticeably so.. that����",3
Really nice work! Thanks,0
"Thank you TeePublic, I love and adore my shirt!! Great quality and the shirt came super fast!",0
"Received exactly what I ordered. Paid for express delivery, and received within short timeframe. Must admit, it would be great, if other businesses would do the same. In all seriousness, thank you, to everyone involved. Very much appreciated. No hesitation, in recommending your business.",0
I had a problem with the sweatshirt I ordered running small and you all fixed the problem with no issues. You guys did great. Thank you,0
"The products that I ordered have the right logo - and the screen printing is ok.The shirt itself is NOT what was shown or what I expected to receive. Two shirts, same problem. So disappointed.",3
"Both items fit great, and l love the ""You Matter"". Thank you.",0
Everything was great!Thanks so much!,0
Men's sizing is great. Women's sizing is waaay off. XXL should have been marked Medium. Will NOT order womens again.,4
Always happy to order from TeePublic! Get many compliments from the shirt too!,1
"Very happy with tshirt,son is gonna wear it opening day for grouse and woodcock������������",1
"Fast delivery, no problems. Seems like a quality t shirt. Would recommend to family and friends.",6
Shirt image is very uneven. Crooked. Dissatisfied,3
I received two tshirts and one had a rip on the seam. Very disappointed,3
"First shirt I was sent, the printing was a bit faded and didn't quite look right. Also, the shirt was super long (even by TeePublic's sizing chart guide), so I initiated a return. The process took a little long, but I was able to swap the shirt out for a different style (same design) and they shipped it to me free of charge and the replacement looked great! I was also able to keep the original long one (which I gave to a taller friend). So, all in all, it worked out just fine. Thanks TeePublic!",0
"I received a damaged shirt and have requested help through customer service, but cannot get anyone to respond. Very disappointed.",3
I was very happy that I was able to get three new designs when I accidentally double ordered. I thinkit is great that they were able to remedy my mistake even though they did nothing wrong on their end.,1
"I made four orders totaling $367.00 within plenty of time for them to arrive before Christmas but one did not. In fact, all of them were guaranteed before Christmas but one of them did not arrive. I���������ve been tracking it for a week. Each day the delivery date would get pushed back another day and here it Christmas and I���������m very disappointed. These were going to be excellent gifts for family from out of town but now they will leave with only a promise that I will mail it to them later. I wanna know what���������s going to be done abo",3
The t-shirt fabric was sideways and the emblems were crooked on multiple shirts For the price of these shirts these are the lowest quality I've ever seen! And unfortunately I purchased quite a few ����,3
comfy and perfect fit according to the size chart the material is soft and the design is even better in person than what it looks like in the picture very happy with my purchase Thanks!,0
I ordered 4 face masks for my 5 year old grandson. The art work was ok on the masks but they were so small they can not be used. The ear loops do not reach from one ear to the next. My grandson is average size 5 year old he wears size 6 in clothing and all of his other children's mask fit just fine. I'm very disappointed these can not be used for anything except maybe dolls.,3
"I ordered a 3xl long sleeve tshirt,because winter is coming and i wanted to be able to wear another shirt underneath..when it arrived it was GIGANTIC!!So i reached out to ask how to exchange,and was told no worries, we will send you a 2xl absolutely free of charge!! What the what?? Now that's what i call great customer service!! I got the smaller size shirt a few days later!! Thank you teepublic!! Will definitely order from you again!! #hellouglies#bouletbrothers#mynewtshirtdestination",0
You are a stellar company. We ordered shirts that were too big. You are exchanging them free of charge! Who does that? No one! We will tell our friends about you. Thank you! And will order again in the future.,0
The mad MSFTS T-shirt and the black Philip T-shirt are both awesome. The shirts are really soft and well-made and the graphics are top quality. Thanks!,0
"Hi there, my son was so exited when i found this site for ghostbusters items, but when the order arrived we were both disappointed the T-shirt waslacking colouring i seemed like even new like my wife had already washed it 10-15 timesAnd some of the masks were apparently folded when they went in the machine to be printed because whenwe received it a corner overlaped and when my son wears a mask it makes a white triangle on the mask.",3
I absolutely love my new tee! Thank you so very much! Highly recommended,0
"The designs are awesome, so many amazing artists and so much amazing art to choose from, the sizes are just what I expected and the shipping didn't take long. If I had to make 1 complaint its that I couldn't get a pink shirt in youth size for my daughter but they did have purple and alot of other nice choices. I love the shirts that I received, thank you teepublic and all the artists that made these shirts possible!",0
"Very disappointed about my order.As I usually wear a T-shirt size Large, taking no chances, I ordered a size XL, which didn���������t fit at all, too small, it looked more like a size Small.And pink",3
I accidentally ordered two of one item and was able to quickly get it fixed before it shipped. It arrived and will be a perfect gift. Very pleased!,1
Smooth and easy purchase. Fast delivery. Thanks!,0
The story written on the shirt is perfect for the audience.Thanks so much.,0
It was fantastic thank you I���������m glad I can suppor,0
"It was ok. One of the stickers is not as nice as the other one, in that it is just an uncut rectangle (not a big deal if the pictures and descriptions made this apparent, but same price similar design sticker, I would have thought they would both have a breakaway cutout). Also, the freight is steep, but, that isn't a feap breaker. My biggest disappointment is that the hoodie is a lot smaller than a regular cut 3x generally is. I was going for a baggy hoodie, which is why I sized up, and it fits, but it fits the same as a regular 2x pretty much. A better sizing chart would be good.",3
"Nice shirt!Good weight, nicely made.Shipped and arrived ASAP, thanks so much!",0
These were amazing and I got them in perfect time. I thank you so much!,0
Company had good communication . They contacted me everytime there was an update to be given. The estimated shipping was 10-20 days. The shirt came a couple days after the 20 day mark. I wasn���������t really concerned about shipment as I knew it would take a little while. But once I got the shirt it was definitely not worth the wait :( The colors were faded in design and the tshirt looked old and worn . I was highly disappointe,3
"Awesome! I had an issue with the size. My husband thought I was smaller than I am. I was flattered but my shirt was way too small! My issue was resolved very quickly, professionally and I am very happy!!!",1
Very pleased! Thank you,0
"Received my order in a timely manner and all the product was as was expected from the vendor, thank you",0

"Thank you, hate to wear a mask but they are not the tipical mask, quality seems good, fit is good.",0
"It made me so happy to see my friends in the ""Peace Love Bocce"" tee shirts I sent them as gifts! Thanks!",0
"The design on the shirt was great, but unfortunately the size is way off. I ordered an XL, and the shirt is maybe a medium. I could barely get it over my head. I am very disappointed as I was extremely excited for my shirt and it's something I've been looking at for quite a while.",3
"The picture was just what I got ,you don't get that alot anymore. I am very happy and will buy from them again.",1
The material used in making the t-shirts is very flimsy and not a hi grade material.Sizing is not accurate.A size larger than normal needs to be placed when ordering.,4
My son-in-law really enjoyed the shirt. Fits great. Come on Christmas Eve! Thank you!,0
"The t-shirt was for my 12 yr old son and it's perfect! great quality, great color. Thank you! This was my 2nd order from you guys and I will most definitely order from you again!",0

"I had no idea that when I ordered the T from Amazon that it came from this organization.That being said, I do realize that Amazon is supported by many other businesses and this one is no exception.I was pleasantly surprised as to how quickly my T came after my order and more impressed with packaging as well.This was a Christmas present for my nephew, but I will be sure to turn to your organization again should I wish to purchase another printed tee.Thank you!Lisa Griffin",0

It took 3 weeks to be delivered. The characters face was terrible.I ordered a large but it fits like an extra small. Very disappointed.,3

The quality of clothing and print design was poor,3
"Top t shirt that I bought off you. I love it, it���������s great quality and the printing is colourful and precise, thank you",0
"I've been a fan of TeePublic for a long time. I enjoy just looking through the different styles and designs. There's something for everyone, and I often buy for friends because I find a design that just fits their personality perfectly. But most of all I enjoy finding a new artist and treating myself to some Whimsy.",1
Awesome stuff.Thanks!,0
"The mask I ordered was way big. Ear loops were too long and shipping seemed to take longer than normal. But on the plus side, customer service said they would ship a new, smaller one asap and to keep or donate original mask. I was ready for a battle in getting a replacement or refund but was pleasantly suprised. Thank you TeePublic.",0
No problems at all. Very pleased with the shirt I ordered! :),1
Product came pretty fast. Ordered a couple days before Christmas and it came within a week or 2. Best thing about this website is how I could find any type of shirt I'm looking for! Regular T-shirts are a brand called Bella Canvas. Thanks for the great product!,0
I am disappointed to be honest and I was looking forward to receiving these. The term sheet fits poorly - i ordered a large because that is my size. The size i received is snug and i clearly need the next size over. Also the quality is thin.,3
"I had a problem with one of my orders and their customer service team took care of it immediately and with no hassle. I will happily order from them in the future due to how efficiently they resolved my issue, going above and beyond!",1

"It took almost 4 weeks to receive my order. When I received my shirt, it was very small and I did follow the instructions to order one size larger than I usually wear. The print on my shirt is also cracking. It should not be cracking, especially if it hasn't been washed. I reached out to the company a week ago about sizing and have yet to get a response. I will never order again from this company. Very disappointing!",3
"The T-shirts arrived timely and as photographed, the only problem one shirt was too small.I reached out in an email, explained the situation,and requested the next larger size.I immediately heard back from Customer Service.A new one is being sent at no additional cost.WOW, I'm impressed!!!!That is what I call Premier Service!THANK YOU.I will definitely be ordering fromTeePublic in the future.",0

Shirt arrived just I as imagined. Very pleased!,1
Received a shirt that was too small for Christmas. Attempted to order the right size but evidently ordered the wrong type fit so it was also too small. I give up!,3
I love the tshirts . I realize they came from two different vendors but I ordered the same size. It was Mens 3x and they are so different. The cut of the sleeves and the length. Love both fabrics and the pics! Thanks!,0

"I've ordered from TeePublic a few times and my orders have always been correct, my shirts perfect, delivered on time, and at a good price. Zero complaints.",6
"The products I received were fine and as expected. The trouble lies in the shipping. I placed an order a month before Christmas with ""Guaranteed by Christmas"" shipping. I know- once an item is shipped its in the hands of the delivery services, but hear me out- The items were shipped via Mail Innovations, which, if you are not familiar, is NOT a guaranteed service in any way- Mail Innovations tells companies that use their service this openly and makes it a very poor choice for a company to use for Guaranteed by any date delivery. One item arrived on time, the other got lost in Ohio for 3 weeks. When I contacted TeePublic days before Christmas,they agreed to reship the item that was lost in transit but would not guarantee Christmas delivery which was a huge disappointment since that was the purpose of the purchase in the first place. So, 3 stars for the product, but the fulfillment left a lot to be desired.",3
"Ordering, delivery and t-shirt were all excellent. Thanks",0
Shirts run WAY small once washed. Really disappointed I spent so much for shirts that don���������t fit my son.,3

"I like the shirt I ordered and received. I ordered an XL and it's probably a little larger than I'd like, but I ordered that size so no big deal. However, I was disappointed with the shipping. My item shipped on April 26th, but I didn't receive it until May 10th. I clicked on the tracking info, but even though it said shipped with UPS, it's through the USPS, so you can't track it. So, even though I paid $7 for shipping, the method used was as slow as can be bought.",3

All around positive experience. Holiday savings lasted beyond Cyber Monday. The order arrived on time. The design is clever and well thought out. Will continue ordering from TeePublic in the future. Thanks!,0
"I love love my new hoodie! Thank you!! My only complaint is, I wish the writing was maybe a bit lower from the collar!?!?",0
"Design is good, but for $20, was expecting the T-shirt to be better quality. It is below average. Fit is poor, too tight around the neck with sleeves too short, and the torso area is almost barrel like. The fabric is sub-par. Get's easily wrinkled, and not comfortable against the skin. The t-shirt can be worn indoors at home at best. Don't even recommend it as a gym wear because the fabric breathes poorly around the print area. The only good thing is the graphic design. Won't be shopping from here again.",4

Just what I expected. Delivery came in reasonable time frame.But I suggest to delivery person to put package closer to door not in plain site from street view.Too much gets stolen as it is.Thank you,0
I bought a printed t-shirt. It took 12 days to receive via postal service. Was disappointed in that because my confirmation said it would be 6-8 days. Probably not TeePublics fault knowing how slow the post office can be.The fabric for the shirt I thought to be a thin knit cotton & not a good quality based on many other t-shirts I have.The print on the shirt was fine & was as I ordered.,3
Shirt looks great & arrived a day early!! My husband loves it too. Thank you...I���������ll definitely be ordering from you all ,0

Super disappointed in the masks I received. The ones I actually received were a different style than what was pictured at time of purchase. The designs are basically pointless because you can���������t tell what they are. Trying to return but no respo,3
I give a 5 star rating. So many designs to choose from and everything I saw I liked. Purchased t-shirts and hoodie as Christmas gifts taking advantage of the holiday discounted prices. The items were shipped quickly and I received them just in time for Christmas. Thank you and I will probably be making more purchases in the future.,0
Smooth transaction. Great art. thanks!,0

Awesome service as usual and great t-shirts. Thank You,0
It was good. Thank you,0
"The print quality of the t-shirt I've received was beyond unacceptable. I cannot believe someone actually looked at the product and said: ""yes, let's ship that to someone"".It's like my 4yo whipped his mouth with it after having a lollipop.Customer service agreed to replace the product, but the design I wanted was already removed from the shop, I had to pick something else (haven't received it yet) so I can't testified if it was 1 bad luck or if each product are the same.I doubt I'll ever order again from Teepublic unfortunately.",4

Liked the print on the t-shirt but disliked the quality of the shirt itself. The fabric is too uncomfortable to wear. Was hopeful that washing it would soften it but it did not.,3

Thank you for your follow through and trustworthy customer service. You are appreciated.,0
The design on the shirt was not as shown on sight.Design was not a nice clear design.Looked cheap.Will not order from this site in the future.,4
"I had ordered a large t-shirt for my boyfriend and was very disappointed with the sizing. It may be a large, but not a MEN'S large. I tried to fill out the information for an exchange, but my order number was not recognized. I could normally deal with a mistake with the size, but making the transaction harder than it had to be really tapped my patience. Fortunately all it took was a direct email (as opposed to completing the regular form) in which I was offered a free replacement shirt. The adjusted size is a perfect fit. While I appreciate the effort the company took to make my order right, I don't know if I will order from them again.",3

"Overall I am pleased with the quality of the tee shirts I ordered.Also, happy with the updates on the progress and shipping of my order.However, disappointed that two identical sizes and companies fit differently, one perfectly and one a tad too small. Also, I ordered two tees and one of the designs is exactly as pictured in the website. The other is a little disappointing and not as vibrant as shown. It happens to also be the one without the perfect fit:(",3
Everything looks Great. It all came in as ordered and arrived Quickly.I look forward to buying more in the future. I bought 9 shirts on my first order.Thanks,0
We have been looking for the perfect yellow Shelby shirt and found an exact replication of the car we have. Love it!!! Thank you!,0

"This was my first order from this company, and it was a good experience. I ama T-shirt person. I wear them, andI ALWAYS give them as gifts. A T-shirt says so much about a person. I buy quirky shirts for the entire family. From engineers, rock hounds, feminists, avid gun owners, gardeners, pot heads, transgender, etc. my family has the all American mix of EVERYTHING. I try to find personalized T���������s for everyone in my family. Some websites have started censoring certain items because it offends ���������some people���������. I found that T Public has it all. I sure don���������t agree with my families interests all the time, but I support how they express themselves, each and every gloriously different one. Thank you for the freedom of T shirt Expression! A t shirt can inspire some of the most interesting discussions from strangers. Sometimes, they make us think. It is pure conversation starter.I���������m glad I for, but this year, no censorship.",0
Just bought for the first time from this website. The payment process was clear and fast and got my product in about a week. I would recommend to everybody based on this sole experience.,6

"Thank you for making such an AWESOME Simple Minds Tee-Shirt! It fits really great, and looks great!! Thank you TeePublic, and to the artist.

Thanks again, and I will definitely will be using you again in the future!Sincerely,Deana Hunt",0
Great company to work with. My item was shipped when they said it would be. I really like my item. Thank you!,0
"Size chart was accurate, order arrived in less than 5 days and product was good quality t-shirt",6
"All my orders took over a month to even ship. The shirt I ordered was packaged fresh after printing, so the image stuck to itself and was ruined. I also ordered a mask that ended up looking nothing like the style they advertised, which ruins the imagery on it. (AKA the whole reason I ordered it) It���������s also already falling apart. It���������s shame such awesome artists use this sit",3
Thank you for sending me a new size of tee! It���������s great and I appre,0
"One of my items was missing when I received a big order. I sent an email, and got a speedy return email saying that the item would be sent out to me. I assumed since this happened so close to Christmas that I would get it after Christmas. To my surprise I received it Christmas Eve. Thanks for the super fast service and the products were high quality. We will definitely be using the store again.",0

"Shirts are always high quality and true to size! Shipping was faster than expected, even in the holidays! Thanks, TeePublic!",0
"The tshirts are cute andgood quality. The order was delivered earlier than expected. My only complaint is I clicked on the shirt showing it was on sale for 15.00 but when I made the order of 19 shirts, the price was 22.00. I did find a discount code for 15% off which helped. I had to order 2 more shirts which I did get them for the 15.00. Just little frustrated that I couldn���������t get the 15.00 sale price the first time. The shirts are for a Senior citizens Line dance Christmas show. Thank you for t",0

"I recieved my order this morning, my son loved everything.Very good quality fabric and a great fit. The design beinga Vintage look was very authentic looking.

"not happy with logos on one of the t-shirts one is very small looks very cheap and un-professional, the hoodie logo is the right size but logo looks faded not a good quality for the price, so 1 out of the 3 products im ok with that's not very good like I said for the amount of money I spent.",4

Was exactly what we were looking for. Shipped Timely.,6
"I was quite disappointed to find that the design was smaller than pictured, and the printing job was done quite poorly. The yellow ink around ""bun"" is inconsistently colored, with some parts appearing darker and almost orange, and others a dilute mustard color. The sweater itself also had frayed and loose threads sticking out all over. For the price, I am extremely disappointed in the quality I received.",3
"Great tshirts! Love the designs! The shipping was slow and missed Christmas which was disappointing. Otherwise, I'm happy.",3
Good shirt. Thanks.,0

"the quality of the picture is terrible, the picture is not clear, there are small stains on the t-shirt, the t-shirt is not worth the money, I do not recommend this site.this was my first and last order here.",4
"My shirt was made right, looked just like the picture. Sizing was accurate. Shipped pretty quick.",6
I ordered a ladies XL which would normally leave a little room for shrinkage. The shirt seems more like a Medium :(,3
My shirt is great. Soft and just like I was hoping when I ordered. Thank you,0
"I received the poorest quality, poorly made, and downright cheap hoodie. The print on the hoodie is difficult to see in places. I'm so disappointed that for $45.00, I got a thin, poorly made hoodie. The picture on the website looks nothing like what I received. Buyer beware, I guess.UPDATE: I was refunded my entire purchase price. I changed my rating to two stars. They should have never sent me the hoodie to begin with due to poor quality, but I appreciate their quick response to the issue.",3
Highest recommendation--shirts were so very well made-- Will definitely shop with you again--thank you,0
Exactly as described and timely! The only graphic t's i buy are from Tee Public!,6
"I got the Trucker Convoy womens vneck tshirt. Love it, but the colors of the transfer are quite faded, like it had already been washed 50X. That's a bit disappointing, but overall the shirt and fit is good.",3
"Great looking cups, very good work, love it, thanks,",0
"One of the shirts I ordered, the logo on the front was completely crooked. This makes the shirt look cheap. Really disappointed that they would send it like that.",3
"I apologize for not writing sooner, the world happened. First of all your website is excellent, this is the 2nd item I have purchased. Which I am sure will follow more. I am extremely pleased with my Bartlet 2020 Tee Shirt, I will be wearing it to work on October 15th, when HBO airs the West Wing Theatrical Presentation: When We all Vote. Thank You again",0
Love the shirt! Quality is perfect and delivery was quick. Thank you,0
The lettering was so dull and not up to my expectations.I was not able to give the shirt as the gift I had intended.,3
Great quality. I am very happy with my purchase.,1
Our fault for mis-sizing. TeePublic graciously sent a better fit.10/10,0
Had a mishap with printing on tshirt and Customer Service addressed it immediately and had a new shirt replaced right away! GREAT SERVICE! Tshirt is great quality and true to size. Very comfortable! I'm very happy with my purchase. THANK YIU!,0
"The ENZO tee shirt is a huge hit with my step-father.His name is Enzo (parents born in Italy) and he is called Vince.Although I ordered the wrong size, he asked my to get him is correct size ASAP.Thank you for designing and producing the perfect surprise Christmas present for this important 92-year old dad.",0
My son loved the product. It was for an OG hoodie that he really wanted. It was super easy and got here very fast. Thanks Tee Public!,0

"I recieved 2 grace jones tshirts today, I love them thanks!",0
T-shirts arrived within days of order and quality is way better than I expected. A fun gift that made my hubby chuckle for days. Worth every cent!,1
"The designs are great, those I have no issue with. The main issue that I had was related to shipping (it took over a month for me to receive my items). Of course, now that I've received the items, I have a new issue. I ordered two tshirts that were described as 'XXL' - the largest size in that was available in that style. These shirts are NOT extra large anything. I'd be surprised if they were larges. They certainly will not fit me, nor the person for whom they were meant to be a gift. I am very disappointed.",3
The shirt ordered printed very poorly. Disappointed with the quality as it was out of register and tee shirt showed though the print. Contacted Customer Service who quickly and kindly refunded my purchase though I still payed a large delivery charge to Canada not refunded.,3
"While the tees themselves are comfy, that is the only reason for 2 stars over 1. The quality and especially coloring of the printed designs that these artists put so much work into is terrible. Images frequently have spots or sections that appear blurred or stretched. I ordered a shirt from one creator that was supposed to be only line art in a beautiful almost electric blue. What I received was a white with an ever-so-slight blue tinge to it. When I tried TeePublic for my own brand, I found major inconsistencies in colors from shirt to shirt, despite being the same print file for both. I also noted everything looked like it had a grey wash over it, dulling all my colors and making some items unreadable. This, of course, is never shown on the mocks of the merch and instead only appears once your merch makes it into your customers hands. Very disappointing and decided to find a much better quality vendor for all my branding needs.",3
Attempted to request exchange.Automated system will not even recognize my order number and system just takes you in a circle to find help.Lousy service.,3
I placed an order for a small child's sweatshirt for my granddaughter's birthday on Sept 21.It was difficult to use the size chart listed but I figured out that I needed a small. I ordered and received an adult small.I reached out to the company to get an exchange and the response and customer service has been poor. I'm very disappointed and will not order again,3
These shirts are AWESOME!!!!I am a new customer and I am a Facebook friend of one of the independent artists.Since I am now ordering shirts from Teepublic I will never again go to a store like DXL or Wal-Mart for any shirt ever again.Teepublic is cheaper and has better quality shirts.Thank you Teepublic.,0
I LOVe this t-shirt. It's so funny and literally the softest shirt I've ever worn. thank you!,0

The picture on the shirt was unacceptable. It took so long for the delivery and so cost to Xmas. I will eat the $20 lost. Certainly am not satisfied.,4
"Ordered a Hunter v. Hunter tshirt got my son for Christmas in a size Large. It arrived and was way smaller than a large. I emailed customer service.

This was my first time buying anything from Tee Public so I didn't know what to expect. I was cautiously optimistic and I was not disappointed. Good product good price and I received my shirt on time. I'm happy.,1
"The shirt came as described and the shirt design is really cute~ I love the art so much :D I wash it inside out and hang it to dry.

Enjoy the soft feel and comfort the T-shirt beings...Great print job!!!,1
"Only two complaints about my experience. First, I paid to have a prio shipping but the date wasn���������t respected for some reason. I didn���������t receive my gifts on time for Christmas which is a bit unfortunate. Second, the size of the t-shirt is really tight for a large one and the measures weren���������t on the website as far as I know. Adding those could be helpful. Otherwise, the quality of the products is good and the prints are awesom",3
Wife and I are very happy with our shirts!,1
"There are a lot of poor designs on the site, but there are also a large number of fantastic designs available if you hunt for them.All in all, I enjoy browsing the catalogue and ordering designs that I enjoy.The quality of the shirts is pretty good as well.",1
I had some trouble finding my size with the tshirts.Teepublic was very patient and accomodating so that I could get the right fit.I am very appreciative of the customer service department and will be purchasing more tees from this company.Thanks again!,0
I purchased a t-shirt. It was exactly what I was looking for. Quick shipping and great looking products. Thanks teepublic.,0

"My husband's favorite tshirt got ruined a few months ago. I have been looking for another to replace it and was having no luck. I came across TeePublic and thought I'd give it a try. I couldn't believe it when I found a very similar one! I ordered it and it came in a very timely manner. When he got it he was thrilled! He said it was even better than the original! Thank you so much for your artists and such a vast variety! My husband doesn't ask for much, so giving him this was so satisfying. I will definitely buy from TeePublic again!",0
Love it thank you soo much,0
"I received the shirts. One of them had an orange stain that will not come out from the fabric when washed. For a product to be compromised with basic quality issues like this, was a disappointment. Also, the inscription on one of the shirts is incorrect. You have quality issues. Again this is doubly disappointing. I paid $50 for these products. I am not satisfied and will not purchase again from your business.",3
My Grandson was very pleased with the shirt I had picked for him.I was disappointed in the delivery service.,3
My T-shirt came and looked exactly as a picture. The time frame from ordering to delivery was awesome as this was a birthday gift. Everything went very smoothly and I am very happy to have helped this art.,1
Originally I had posted a complaint. T public got back with me right away and made it right. The print was too small and they shipped me a new shirt expedited exactly how I wanted it. Thank you guys for making it right. Great customer service.,0

I got my t shirts promptly. Just right. I would use TePublic again.,6
I was very disappointed in the ladies size 2x. It looked on the model like it should be bigger.I wear a ladies large and a 2x in ladies was more like a ladies large. I guess the ladies tee shirts are more sized for teenagers.,3
"amazing graphics, great t-shirts, and fast shipping. I will buy from TeePublic again. Thank you!",0
Do what you say and say what you doThank you,0
Both shirts look awesome and they fit my husband and me perfectly. We get smiles and comments whenever either of us wears ours. Thank you so much!,0

My shirt was exactly what I wanted and the delivery was faster than expected! So happy with my experience.,1
The shirts were fantastic and arrived just as promised. I will definitelyorder again. Thank you!,0
Well I ordered a men's size medium and it came very long and slender like a kids extra long shirt and since it was to small I wanted to exchange for a large it's impossible this is the hardest site to communicate with after paying almost 40$ on 2 t shirts it shouldn't be so hard to get the correct size I need. It's very disappointing.,3
Great Customer service and quality t shirts.Thank you,0
My boyfriend LOVED his our lord and savior Cthulhu shirt it was his favorite gift thus far! Thanks soo much for making him happy,0

I placed two orders in early December two days apart. I received the first one right on time as expected.At the time of the second order i was told it would take 6-9 business days to arrive. It arrived well after the party so we were not able to use it. I wasted my time and money.,3

"From the day i ordered a sweatshirt from teepublic, everything went downhill. I never received any initialcommunication that it was being sent.When I contacted them by email to inquire i was sent an automated reply thatvthey would get back to me within two days. That never happened.Only when I contacted PayPal did I get a reply.They said the order was on its way. It wasn���������t.They never sent it.Then I was told they would expedite it so it would arrive on Christmas Eve.It didn���������t.The day after Christmas a small t shirt arrived which was the completely incorrect item.After contacting them again, and also PayPal, they say they have issued a refund for my order.Very disappointing.

"When i orded my product it, it ""said"" it was shipped within mintues on the website (as if there stick already printed). The next day the Hoodie went on sale and i was upset that i couldnt cancle the order to save some money due to USD to AUD dollar exchange rate (paid $100 for a hoddie). And a few days later got an email saying it was being shipped. So i missed out on my sale. Id like there to be a more of a clear shipping display website verse email.

"What made this experience great was the ease of shopping on the website, shirts were on sale, the quality of the t-shirts and the production of the designs. My family has enjoyed every item I've purchased from TeePublic. Be mindful of the return policy - only for defective items or size exchange. (My daughter ordered 2 of the exact same shirt by mistake.

Love the masks!I have gotten many compliments about them. Thank you.,0
"The t-shirts I just received are un wearable! I ordered 3 in a 3xl. NONE of them are a 3Xl! One says it is a 2xl, which I did not order! The one that is closest to the correct size is more sized for a 2xl. I am usually careful to check the sizing charts before I order, so either your sizing charts are misleading or I only looked at one before ordering not thinking there would be different sizing on different shirts. I also bought a t shirt for my niece in a womens large, but it relates more to a small. I am very disappointed in these shirts and will try to send back, and will try to never buy from this company again!",3
Love the design.Comfy fit and fast shipping.Thanks,0
"Although the shipping was lightening fast, the t shirt was definitely was not the XXL womens size. I compared it to one of my daughters med-large Banana Republic t-shirts. It was virtually the same exact size. I was so disappointed I could not wear it for Halloween. Customer service communication us great though! I was kept up to date on the printing process and then the shipping process.",3

I did not get what I ordered and I sent an email and never got no response very dissatisfied $45 sweatshirt is a lot of money to pay and you don't get what you wantyou sent me something and asked me to send you a picture I should not have to send any pictures besides I don't even know how to do that and get it to you you have on my computer what I ordered and I'm sure you have on your computer what you sent me which was not what I ordered. Then you get an email after you post your review and they want to make good which I don't believe because they never answered any of my emails in the past personally I would never recommend this company. Actually I shouldn't even have given you a one-star that's how disappointed I am with your order,3

"So far I am pleased with the purchase.I bought 6 tees with graphics on them.The large size fits me perfect, which often are too tight.The tees are light weight and comfortable. Last the graphics seem to be applied in quality manner; not a cheap rubbery feel. 4 stars for now, I have not washed them tees yet, but for the overall for cost, delivery, and initial first wear, off the hook designs and appearance...Happy!",1
"Customer service is top notch, but the shirts I've ordered have been wrong several times. Either the size is wrong, I receive the wrong design altogether, or the design isn't centered on the shirt. It's just frustrating when you receive the shirt hoping to wear it, and it's wrong, more than once.BUT they do get back to me the same day with a new shirt made and mailed out so they do make up for it.",5

"I was looking for an item and was just 'Googling"" it, I cam e across this site that had the item I was looking for and was offering a very good sale so I took a chance and bought it and I was extremely happy. Th item actually arrived 4 day early which in my book sets them apart from the heard, if I have to made one critique it is that the item I ordered I was a Large but it fits like a very loose Large or possible a tight X-Large, I'm hoping it will shrink a bit when I wash it.",1
I ordered a t-shirt and stickers. The stickers came really quickly but the t-shirt took a good bit longer.I'm very happy with both.,1

I did order the tee shirt 1 size bigger - an xl instead of a large and it was way smaller - I would say a medium possibly small. A lot of the lettering looked smeared and I couldn���������t read the bottom of the shirt . I do support independent artists but was disappoint,3

I drove 90 minutes to address this issue as the order was for my elderly friend who had to go out of town unexpectedly.I contacted CustomerSupport, explained my problem.

"I was pretty disappointed with the quality of printing on the shirts I received. The graphics look so great on the website, but when you get the actual shirts, the images look low-resolution and cheap. The printing is very thin, so the colors are muddy and you see the color of the T-shirt fabric bleeding through the graphics. The words don���������t appear well-defined, and actually look blurry.

Great experience. My t-shirt was too small for me so I asked for an exchange and they immediately sent me a new shirt and told me to keep the other one and donate it. Thanks !,0
Ordered two tees. I was excited because the shirts were lighter material. I live in AZ and it's hot. As I put one of them on it completely tore. Cheap material. Disappointed I can't even wear one of them.,3

Teepublic is the only site I trust with my tee needs. Redbubble is the absolute worst and Teepublic is most definitely the best.

This was supposed to be a gift for my husband. The transfer design turned out poorly and shouldn't have been delivered. Also the size is off. My husband always wears a size extra large.

My order was filled and sent to me quickly. The inquiry (s) I had with yourcustomer service people were polite & speedy.Only suggestion I would make is for you to get/use a better quality cotton foryour tee shirts.

"The material is good. The design is good. But the print is off center. I paid 30 bucks for a shirt that is off center. Seriously, doesn't anyone do good quality work anymore. No one even takes the time to make sure the print is center? Wth. Very disappointing. Has money, mass production and cutting corners ruined every single product out there?!?! Desks and dressers made out of bullcrap particle board. Refrigerators and dishwashers that constantly break down. I can't even get a goddamn T-shirt printed right?!?! I could understand if these things were cheap. BUT THEY ARE NOT EVEN CHEAP. Yet they are. They don't make them like they used too. That's for damn sure.",3

Crooked logo art! I waited a month for my $30+ dollar t-shirt to be delivered and when it finally came in the mail the logo i picked out was laid out crooked. So disappointed and will likely never suggest t-public or buy from them again. Not even worth the wait to have it fixed or replaced. Straight in the trash what a waste.,3

The two shirts I ordered were very goodim happy with them thank you.,0

"Disappointed in the quality of the tee shirts--very thin material, they don't feel substantial..Also the emblem looks like like it was put on using heat and it looks like it will crumble and not last very long after washing--I've had previous experience with these kinds of stuck-on pictures or emblemsand they usually start to crack and lose their quality. I will not buy from this company again; for good quality I use Cafe Press--I've bought many tee shirts from them and they are very reliable.",3

"You had offered guaranteed delivery before Christmas and it wasn't delivered until 2 days after Christmas.Your resolution offered was a 35% off next order coupon. Which is ridiculous and doesn't resolve the fact you didn't deliver on guaranteed delivery as promised. I know abt shipping delays.... I don't need an explanation on that, since COVID we all know that. Maybe you shouldn't offer guaranteed delivery going forward and I'd you do you should stand behind that and not give a 35% off coupon for another ourchase when I am already frustrated by this experience.",5

"So updated this review. Very happy that Tee Public is kindly sending me a replacement for the George Reeves B/W Superman Symbol T-shirt at no cost to me.That's really...um...Super!They have an easy ""photo upload"" that I used to illustrate the flaw on the design. Very handy.It was disappointing that it wasn't gotten right the first time, but I'm looking forward to the second try. Thumbs up!My not so great original review is below:*****Fairly disappointed in the George Reeves Superman Symbol (black and white) I received today. Firstly, it's lavender to purple. I was hoping for a black or grey.Secondly, there appears to be a flaw, which looks like a blue ink pen mark across the Symbol image on the lower left.Not happy at all.The other T, a Toshiro Mifune Sanjuro image, is pretty all right. No complaints there.",3
"The shirt was really comfortable, arrived promptly, as promised, and sizing up was a good idea for fit! I would buy again!",6

"I received the NRA Crewneck Sweatshirt with a burnt hole in the bag, and therefore shirt. Happened in transit and I contacted the PO and never even got back to me. Then contacted TEEPUBLIC who asked for a photo. Then within days, I had a new shirt to replaced the burnt one. About the sweatshirt, it fit perfectly and the material was top notch. Thanks to you all! George Dvorchak",0
Item was exactly as described and came even faster then estimated shipping time. Thank you so much!,0

Very happy with how the shirts came out. The quality of both the shirt and design is top notch. Will order again.,1
I love this design and I did take the advice of others to order a larger size. Communication with the team was responsive and appreciated.The shipping time was acceptable and met my expectations.Thank you so much,0
If there was a zero I would have picked that. I payed extra for a premium shirt and it was cheaply made. Very thin. Very poor quality shirt. VERY POOR. Reminds of the shirts you buy at the swap meet that cost 5 for $20. I am very disappointed and will never buy another shirt from you guys again. If Premium is the best quality shirt you guys have then you are not offering the customers the best quality out there and you guys will not be in business for much longer. Even the design was poorly done and is faded. I am so upset I feel like you guys stole my hard earned money. I really want my money back!!!!!!!,3
Verg good service well crafted shirts been looking for the one I have for years thank you,0
"Absolutely delighted with the quality of the long sleeve "" GILDAN"" T shirt I ordered.Size is true and my partner, who is a T shirt junkie, said these are the best make of T shirts because they wash well and don't go out of shape.Highly recommended.Thank you TeePublic!",0
"I ordered and received 3 HH43 Huskie Vietnam T-shirts. I an very pleased with the design and quality. However, when I tried to order 2 more T-shirts your system would not accept my credit card (5 times on 5 different days). I know it's not the card as I have used it successfully on other sites. Thanks.",0

Thank you for the speedy delivery and the great service!,0
My shirt arrived today. Quality and perfect fit!Thanks again!,0
Product arrived on time bit disappointed that it was iron on print rather than screen print,3
I really don't like making these types of reviews but I'm really disappointed in the quality of the shirts I ordered. They look as if they have been warn for over a year already as the print has a very grained fade to it. I'm not happy spending 60 on 2 shirts for this horrible quality.,3
"I ordered a couple of shirts online. They eventually arrived in this part of the world and I'm really pleased with them. My consumer test is whether I would shop with this company again. The answer is an unqualified, YES.",6
The hoodie made a big hit for Christmas! It was made well and made my Granddaughter very happy! Thank you.,0
The mask took a long time to come but that���������s ok.But the part that goes around your ears isn���������t elastic so it���������s a tight fit.,6
Tee shirt came in with papa word instead of grandma which is way better. Product was a fast delivery from out of country. Good transaction and very happy with everything.,1
"This is a legit site and not a scam. My cousin received his shirt in the mail,and I'm thankful.",0
Excellent quality t-shirt! Thanks!,0
I loved the print work on all 3 of the sweatshirts I bought as well as the t-shirt but the material on the sweatshirts is extremely thin. Normally sweatshirts are a lot thicker but for the most part I'm happy so thank you ����,0

Exactly what I ordered. Very happy.,1
I ordered2 shirts. One looked great. The other was not at all like the picture. I tried to contact you through your website and it would just keep sending me in circles. U finally got an email through about the shirt and was told to go the same route. Nothing was resolved. I am forced to send pics through snail mail. I do not want a refund. I want what J paid for. But I will never use your website again and will warn people of the reasons why. Very disappointed,3
"Fast shipping, nice design and arrived in perfect condition. Thankyou!",0
"Not disappointed in product, BUT - I am sure I wrote in the order that I 'must receive it BY R 10 Feb. 2022'It did not come until late last week.I am disappointed that part of my request was ignored.",3
I was very happy with my experience. The ordering process was easy and all my items were delivered in a timely manner. The size and quality were great. I will definitely order again. Thank you for this pleasant experience.,0
"The delivery was fast and the print looks good, as expected.I'm a bit disappointed by the quality of the fabric. I wouldn't have minded to pay a but extra if there the option to get a high quality fabric.Another observation, not negative nor positive, I found the L size to be a bit too big from what I used to.",3

Great service and T shirts - thanks!,0
"I love the products, but I don't love the shipping model. I'd rather have higher prices on individual items than get hit with a gigantic shipping bill at the end. I paid $20 to ship 3 posters, and I was very upset to have that surprise at the end. I wanted to cancel my order, but I'd already invested hours shopping, and I didn't have time to start over again.",3

I totally enjoy wearing t-shirts that I have yet to see anyone else wear! Awesome!!!,1
I was very disappointed the size XL was like a sizesmall. I sent it to my granddaughter in Texas & she loved the T-Shirt but guess she needs a 3x according to YOUR SIZE CHART. Don���������t know how she can return it without a return label,3

Ordering the shirt was easy.Delivery was quick - no problems.Thank you.,0
"Customer service and selections are unbeatable. Website could use some updating e.g. adding a way to save selections to facilitate re-finding them later, as identification of thirts to find and return to them are challenging.However, the company and their offerings are awesome. Highly recommend.I had 3 of 6 tshirts that arrived and were too small for a family member, so TeePublic prepped the next size and and sent them free.I have been a good customer, and will remain so. They are one of my go-do site for tees and gifts. Rock on! Thank you. Stay safe. And don't forget to vote!",0

I have ordered several items from TeePublic and have been very happy with the products I've received.

"I ordered a hoodie from TeePublic and, although upon prompt delivery, I needed to make an exchange. The process was SUPER easy. Diana and Georgiana were pleasant, courteous, and not only fixed the problem but did so in an extremely timely manner. Thanks TeePublic! Highly recommended.",0

"I ordered a phone case for my daughter for Christmas, not realizing that I ordered one to fit her old phone and not her new one.

Very happy customer that will be returning!",1
I was a little disappointed with the quality of masks.However the tshirts were fine.,3
Man I'm a big wrx sti fan. I currently own a 2001 legacy gtb e tune/rev d right hand drive vehicle. It's a third Gen wagon and since yall didn't have one in design I got your 2nd Gen wagon instead.

My nephew really wanted a t shirt with this Roblox logo. He googled it and found your site. I was dubious about ordering but glad I did. It is perfect. I also liked the pictures that showed how the different sizes fit. It helped me to order the right size. Thanks.,0
"I've been ordering t-shirts for many years at Moteefe, Shirtcity, Speadshirt etc. Read a few bad reviews, but decided to give TeePublic a chance because of the designs.First off, pricing is excl. vat, which is very uncommon for private sales (vs b2b were it is always done), making the final total sum a very disappointing. This lead me to wait ordering. When i looked at my shopping cart the next day, suddenly prices had lowered about ���������6 per shirt (excl. vat) and brought the price to the competitors level.The order was made on and shipping was fast (3 business days).Upon receiving i noticed the bag was a little small to hold 5 t-shirts my size (XL). Opening confirmed that the t-shirts are rather thin and are see through. I ordered the tri-blend so may others types may be thicker, but not what i was expecting and seriously doubting whether they will hold up over time. Same goes for the print. Not the worse i have seen, but i can't shake the feeling the some was tr""ink"". Future will tell, but for now... i don't feel like i bought a good product, maybe even feel a little cheated. For the moment, i will buy my t-shirts elsewhere until these from TeePublic have proven their worth.",3

As of this date 12/30 I have not received my order and I am very disapointed as it was a Christmas gift.,3
Products shipped quickly and arrived promptly but the quality of the fabric is mediocre for the price and the images were not as vibrant as depicted online. The overall effect is cheap. I do not recommend.,4

"I ordered 4 items. One shirt came quickly, the other 3 took a rather long time with the shipping info not being completely accurate. The shirt I ordered was nice. The 3 hoodies I ordered do not have the best screen print quality at all. The 2 kids ones are pretty bad so I'm definitely disappointed as these were Christmas presents and it's too late to have them fixed. The other hoodie is for me which is a little bit better screen print quality but I imagine after a couple washes it'll start coming off.",3

"The quality of the T-shirt is terrible. The 2XL African print T-shirtI ordered for my husband came faded. He obviously can't wear that!. I would have given it a 1star but the African print is amazing. It was a big waste of money for that price. I paid over 40cd for that particular T-shirt. I bought four T-shirts: two for my kids, my husband and me. I had great expectations after reading some of the reviews. I paid the original price for it which is over 30cd for adult sizes. I paid an additional shipping cost and an extra 15cd for costumes.Just imagine the amount spent and then receiving a faded blackT-shirt, nicely packaged sent from the US to Canada. I am so disappointed, to say the least! would I want a repeat of that experience ? Obviously NO!",3

I gave it as a gift to a friend who had just lost her mother, who sang ""You are my sunshine"" all the time, and we sang it at her funeral. My friend was delighted and thrilled with the pillow, as a reminder and connection to her mom. The pillow arrived in a timely manner; I am in Ontario, and often products takes many weeks to arrive.

Good and not so good.The materials were as promised but the size was NOT as expected.I ordered a large ladies and it was small.Lots of money for something not too fit.It was a Christmas gift for grand child.Very disappointing.I have ordered many shirts and this is the only one that disappointed.,3

Im dissapointed as it took 3 weeks to get the replacement shirt I ordered as the first one didn't fit and due to this I couldn't wear it for what it was intended for because the it was too late.Just don't know why it took so long to get the second shirt when it was advertised for weeks leading up to Christmas that if shirts were ordered by a certain date it was guaranteed to be delivered by xmass. I had re ordered weeks before deadline and still only received my replacement shirt after xmass. The original shirt got here super quick but it seems like the replacement took almost 3 weeks.,3
The Prints were Amazing & very colorful thank you so much ! Although the Tees did run a little small but fit ok. Other than that the item was exactly as ordered ! Great job guys !!,0

The size I ordered was too small. You guys sent me a better size no questions asked. Thank you.,0

"This is my second time ordering from teepublic. Ordered about 5 graphic t shirts and a custom Hamilton mug. Delivery was timely, t shirt designs were so creative and looked good. Very happy with the purchases. Also had to contact customer service for an update to my shipping address and they were very quick to respond and helpful and got my questions answered. I'm very satisfied with all the custom items I purchased from teepublic and their customer service!",1
"I love the quality of the products and all the amazing designs that artists have created. However, as a customer outside of the US I found it difficult to navigate how much the order and the shipping would cost. My order cost a lot more than I had anticipated, which will probably hinder me from ordering from TeePublic in the future. It would have been helpful to have an option to select that I was an international or Canadian shopper, to be notified in advance that shipping would cost extra, and/or to be able to view the prices in my own currency.Thank you though! I love the wide range of designs and products.",0
Arrived earlier than expected.Very happy!,1

"Could not find information on t-shirt material composition when I ordered.I selected the ""premium"" t-shirt thinking it would be higher quality, but was disappointed to find the material was thin and was a 60/40 cotton/poly blend.Would have been nice to have a thicker, 100% cotton option.Selected this design because of the group association.I could not find the title of the shirt or the name of the artist when I went to the general site's URL and used the search feature; I had to use a specific link/QR code that the artist provided.Thought shipping costs were somewhat high.",3

Great product.Arrived in timely manner.Thanks.,0
"Unfortunately I was very disappointed with what I received. I looked at many websites that offered similar products, but the reviews I read made me feel confident I would be pleased with the gifts I was purchasing for my friends for Christmas. Price wasn���������t as much of a concern as the quality I was looking for. I have not tried to contact the company yet to see what they are willing to do about it, but my issue is the actual print on the sweatshirts I purchased. They look as if the ���������stamp��������� they used had ran out of ink. They look as if they have already been worn several times. The sweatshirts themselves are fine, it is the print I am upset about, unfortunately. Again, I have not contacted the company to rectify the situation, so I have no feedback regarding customer service",3
My tee shirts were beautiful and sizing I'd your to git.I'm happy,1
Perfect fit. Well made and lightweight. Plan to order more. Thanks,0
Excellent customer service and cute products!One t-shirt noted that it ran small so I happily ordered up.The other items had no such information and they definitely ran small But a quick email to TeePublic and everything was resolved in super fast fashion.Thank you - totallyamazing customer service.,0
"The products are quality, colourful and are like what is advertised on the site. Thank you",0
Unfortunately 2 of the shirts are not correct and are not usable. The colors of the print are completely wrong. One shirt has spots/ink stains on the back and side. The shirts also were very late to arrive.,4
I have ordered before and had A great experience.This has been a bit of a disappointment.I ordered youth Lg for both a long sleeve tee and hoodie. They are vastly different in sizes. One will have to be returned after Xmas.I followed the size chart listed on the website and they are way off. The other thing is that 2 of the hoodies look extremely cheap screen printed quality that look like they will come off after a few washes.,3

I Happy I have few things in Cart leave there My VA check will be in my checking around First of Month. Thank you madam,0
Just what I wanted. It was a gift so I'm glad it fits and and it is visually clear. It is really appreciated. If I had to make any suggestions I would say that the picture could be put up more on the shirt as the top part of the shirt feels empty (not that it matters just being nitpicky). But seriously thank you,0
"Got them,The Canadian flag one was perfect,very happy with that mask, the flower one was to small and not enough of the flower print, shipping took a bit.",1
Would have been 5 stars but shipping killed it,3
"I ordered a shirt to be made with express shipping. The shirt was made within 3 days of ordering, which I was good with. The shipping used never delivered my package although their records state they did. I reach out to see if another can be sent. I took 2-3 days to get a response from an actual customer care agent and not an automated response. Once product was remade it was shipped out, with standard delivery. Im fine with paying the cost of the shirt itself. But what I'm upset with is the fact I paid over $15 for express shipping and it was around 2 weeks late, and no refund issued on shipping. If I don't receive something for the shipping costs I'll likely not be a return customer.",3
Took 2 weeks to ship and was charged $6 to wait that long. The screenprint is fuzzy. The shirt is scratchy. Very disappointing.,3
T-shirt fits perfectly and others loved it. Thank you!,0
I am so disappointed the T-shirt I ordered came quickly but I ordered large and it's more like small your product runs very small I am unable to give the T-shirt to the person I purchased it for because it's too too small and I am very disappointed I did not order a small shirt I ordered a large,3

I was offered a new one to replace it and it arrived so quickly exactly the way I ordered it. I would definitely work with you guys again. Thanks for your time and efforts,0
"I got the shirt in a very timely manner, but held off reviewing until I washed the tee shirt.Even though I got the men's large, assuming it might shrink a bit, unfortunately, it shrunk considerably when it was laundered.And although I used softener, it's still badly wrinkled.So, my opinion is:even though the cost was not cheap, the tee shirt is cheap and of poor quality (especially for $20!).Other than the wonderful graphic, I think this shirt is worth about $5.00.Very disappointed!I planned on wearing this shirt a lot, but it just looks too cheap to wear places...",3
I was very pleased with the product and the speed of delivery. Thanks so much.,0
"No issues with TeePublic were experienced, however the post office had issues getting our package delivered. The folks at TeePublic were quick to jump in and help us out. Many Thanks TeePublic folks.",0

Fast shipping.My first experience was positive on all points,6
The designs never look like they do on the site. 3 times in a row we've ordered shirts where the graphics are faded and the sizing isn't right. I'm extremely disappointed in TeePublic and won't be buying anything else from them.,3
My daughter LOVES her sweatshirt! Thank you!,0
The product was terrible! This shirt was wrinkled and the design was completely worn off. I previously contacted you to express my disappointment. I got no reply. I'm very dissatisfied with this company and the purchase.,3

I ordered a shirt on May 29 for a gift. On June 3 I got an email that my shirt is still in printing. This morning (June 10) the shirt still shows as printing. Not impressed at all that it is taking so long. Clearly it won't be delivered in time.,3

The only thing that I was a bit disappointed in was how long it took to get the tees.,3

"I ordered one tote bag and one face mask to support the ���������Meat is Immoral���������.com campaign and I have to say I am extremely disappointed in the quality of both products. The price was way to high for what���������s being put out. First of all the tote bag is made with clear plastic thread that looks so cheap and not at all durable. Second the face mask is so ridiculously huge, great for a man with a beard but not an average sized woman, it should be available in sizes. Also the logo on it is poor quality, blurry almost, and printed on a pleats! You can���������t even see what is says while it���������s on your face!

"The two t-shirts I ordered for my great-grandsons arrived while we were on vacation so we just picked them up yesterday to see them for ourselves.They're very cute, however, the 3T looks like a size 2T (measured against four other 3T's) and the 2T is very, very small. It looks like an 18 month size compared to other 18 month shirts.In addition 100% cotton so we have to allow for shrinkage when laundered.We'rehighly disappointed since our little guys love bugs and the artwork on the shirts is so cute.HOWEVER, we'll have to use the 3T for our 2T-size great-grandson, and send back the 2T one.Perhaps someone in your company used the wrong sizing chart on these.",3

I ordered shirts but they were too snug. I was dreading having to go through the return process so I procrastinated it. When I finally didit was so darn easy I literally just requested a new size and they sent it and told me to keep the old one... didn't cost anything. didn't have to go anywhere to ship anything... and I think it took one day for them to get back to me.,7
"Designs and colors and service are excellent. The only problem is that the website states that the shirts are ""pre-shrunk"". Based on this information, I ordered shirts that fit my actual size. I washed the shirts in cold water and dried them on the ""Low"" setting. They came out of the dryer as tight-fitting muscle shirts, not regular-fitting Tee Shirts. If, in fact, the shirts are pre-shrunk, they still shrink more than any pre-shrunk shirts I have ever purchased.",7

One of the designs on one of the shirts I bought immediately started falling apart. And all my shirts were supposed to be medium but one of the shirts was an XL. They stuffed all 5 shirts into a tiny bag and the shirts designs were creased. I will not be ordering from you again.,7

My Daughter is a big Dragonball z fan and loves Android 17 & 18. She was super thrilled to receive the shirts that we ordered for school.,7
Absolutely love the designs of the shirts I ordered. Quality is great and shipped so quickly!!,7
The design of the 2 shirts I ordered is excellent and appears as depicted.Fit is true to size for American sizes.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the shirt material is lighter than the usual and I prefer the beefier material as it lasts longer.,7

Great quality and pricing and quick delivery!!~,7
"I ordered a t-shirt from TeePublic however, a different t-shirt design than what I ordered was delivered.When I contacted them about the error, they immediately sent out the correct shirt and told me to keep the other one.The service representative couldn't have been more helpful or professional.",7
The tshirts are awesome! My son loves them!,7
I love it���������Designer is intune wi,7
I was so excited to receive my tees and I have more in my cart waiting. But when they arrived one which was pictured to have brought orange writing on the word VARIANT was more like a dull orange red. The other tee was pictured to be a dark get which I thought would make the design pop but it wasn't very dark at all so the design looks cheap and hard to read. I kept them but I don't see myself wearing them as I had Outfits planned. Now I'm questioning the quality and visual accuracy of the items in my cart.,7
"The design was perfect, but I was disappointed in the quality of the T-shirt material. Light weight and for the price I expected more substance.Sincerely, SHR",7
"The shirt was stained, looked like from the print.",7
Quick deliveryHelp with a problem Quick replacement!,7
Tee shirts were really nice designs but run Really small and cannot be returned...so one I bought is useless to me ����,7
I was super impressed with return policy! Fantastic service! Love my shirts. Just needed a bigger size.,7
I bought this as a Christmas gift from my sons to my husband and they are so excited for Daddy to open their gifts they chose!,7
I love the selection of the shirts! Who knew I could find such a nostalgic memory here. The shirt quality is really good!,7
I ordered two items.I received them in a timely manner.Both are high quality.Both are gifts for Christmas.I will be ordering some for myself after the holidays are over.,7
"Great t-shirt, colour of print seems a little out but not sure if that's because of the t-shirt colour I chose or the print itself. Excellent service, quick and good value for money.",7

Amazing! ������������������,7
Great designs and great garments they fit perfectly which can be a problem for me as sometimes medium is too small and sometime medium is too big,7
"Their t-shirt products are well printed. If there is a mistake they are quick to correct it and send you a new shirt. They seemed to have switched shirt manufacturers and the shirts are a little tighter, but still fits. Repeat customer of TeePublic. Greatly recommend.",7
Quality made products.Fast friendly service.Will definitely order from them again!,7
The t shirt designs were exactly what I expected so I am happy about that. I love the print ideas. The shirts themselves are not top quality but for $13 I can't complain. I definitely will order from them again and I've already recommended them to friends!,7
Great product. Even faster shipping.,7
The ink looks faded as if it had been washed twenty-five times. First two shirts did not have the same problem.,7
The products are true to color and the quality is really good,7
"I bought a shirt for a significant other and it's a perfect fit, true to size and he loves it. So I'm very satisfied.",7
"This order was way better than the first.The designs were perfect it's just the t-shirt brands that you use concern me.I sold my t-shirt company and I feel that Anvil is not a great shape t-shirt.The rest are good to use.This order was the Gildan Hammer and Bella Canvas and love it.I don't use the Anvil t-shirt I bought off you last order, the t-shirt looks like I have wings on my shoulders lol.These awesome designs can not be on a crappy t-shirt.Thanks again for the great service just had to let you know about the brand Anvil.A little tip .. Poly blend is all I wear now, they last longer and they don't bacon neck.",7
"Yea, verily, the shirt was soft and good.",7
"I have bought more than my share of great tshirts.Never a problem with any of them.And if I needed to change a size or anything after my order has been placed , the customer service is hands down the best!",7

I love it! Great design and color.,7
"I have had a great experience with Tee Public. They have a great selection of Designs and Designers. Their T-Shirts are of high quality, and at a great price.",7
Very nice shirts! Great delivery time.,7
"Bought quite some shirts from them, the quality is very good for the price, especially when you order at the sale they have every couple of months. Even the regular T-shirts are good(Male), but I love the ""Heather"" ones the most. I just ordered the female Tanktop (premium racerback) for the first time, but I expect same quality. So far my oldest shirt from them is 8 months old and still in use almost every week. Ordered a phone case from them once too, but if you are going to spend that much money, make sure to get the ""Protective"" one, because the ""Slim"" one just seemed a breakable piece of plastic to me. Word of advice though: If you want to fairly support the creators of the art, make sure to keep your eyes open for signs of people that stole art :)",7
It���������s a very cute tshirt but the reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it was a gift and it came without a tag as if it was used and it smelled ,7
Excellent purchase good selection quick shipping,7
The three tshirts I ordered were amazing- my friends were jealous so I am going to be ordering more for them!,7
Nice quality shirts. Ordered from here multiple times and will order again.,7
Loved the designs and the shirts were super comfortable.,7

Love my Tee shirt! I stand by that woman from Michigan������������������,7
So far I���������ve bought around 5 shirts with teepublic and all of them were great!! When I had trouble with one of my shipments customer service was very fast and able to help me. And the quality of the t-shirts and softness is well balanced out. You get your money���,7
I found more tshirts than I could possibly imagine. I love the variety of choices. Delivery is always as promised.,7
I've purchased about 7 t-shirts now.All of them are made of high quality material.The designs are very unique which is why I keep coming back.,7
"I will definitely order from TeePublic again. They���������re not joking when they say, ���������they will make it right for you, until it���������s right���������. I Ordered the wrong size, and they just sent me new sizes ",7
The shirt was true to its description and size.Shipping was a little slow but I think it was weather related and not reflective of the company.,7
"Easy, quick - no problems",7
"After a few hiccups, this company has turned me into a satisfied customer. Their customer service was great and they kept me informed every step of the way. They were determined to make things right and I really appreciated it.",7
"Ordered, on Dec 7, guaranteed before christmas. Never showed up. Had to reorder, came in January.Terrible service. What does guaranteed even mean? Teepublic simply offered to sent the thing again after Christmas. Way to go Tee Public. I threatened to cancel and never buy from them again if i didn't get a discount. I was given a coupon code for future purchases.Guaranteed does not mean guaranteed, plain and simple.",7
"I open my package as soon as it arrives to find out that 2/3 of my order are WRONG. I immediately email customer service on December 16th. It has been a week. I know you received it because you responded asking for pictures, which I promptly sent. I sent them on December 18th. And NOTHING. This is unfair. I paid my money and ordered them in time for Christmas and I even gave you enough time to fix the problem and get back to me but you have completely ignored me!! I won���������t have presents to give my friends on Christmas because you guys screwed me over. My multiple emails have gone unanswered and it is obviously too late for you to get them to me in time. So please acknowledge a PAYING CUSTOMER and let me talk to someone otherwise I will report the charges to",7
"Best place to get shirts online. I get lots of compliments and people asking me where did I get that shirt. Prices are great and they have sales often as well. Even have larger sizes for big guys like myself. Overall, my favorite shirt store online.",7
"Unique designs, quality fabric and easy ordering process!",7
The customer service has been some of the best I have ever dealt with.,7
"I rated at 4 stars because I believe there is always room for improvement.After all, we are human.The product is much better than the computer screen generates.I am impressed and very pleased. Yay for independent artists!!",7
My sweatshirt and artwork exceeded my expectations. I placed an order for another one tonight.,7
"The travel coffee mugs are perfect. The graphics always come out clear. The notebook looks really good to. I thought it was going to be 8.5 x 11, but that���������s my fault for not reading it. The shirts, honestly, the quality of the graphics are mediocre at best. I���������ve ordered from Tee Public for several years and this is the worst quality I���������ve seen on the graphics. On the computer they look 4k, in real life they look like fuzzy antenna tv from the 80���������s. The colors are muted and the prints are just not solid opaque color. Like, if you paint a room, and have it turn out well it���������s gotta have 2 to 3 coats. These shirts look like a wall with 1 coat of paint. I�������",7
"Nice T-shirt, shipped quickly!",7
"Excellent quality shirts! I will buy again. I'm a big guy and I was a little worried that the 5XL wouldn't fit me, but it did. Good job guys.",7

"I ordered a shirt for my Fiancee for Christmas, I was promised that It would be there by then and it didn't Show up. It got lost Somehow When I paidalmost what the shirt was worth in shipping. However, I reached out tothe company and I got the shipping refunded and they sent another one. The shirt Itself Is killer, andafter, the company killed it for me.",7
"TeePublic delivered my order in an extremely timely way, and when the size was not right they sent me a larger size - also promptly. The quality of the fabric and workmanship was excellent and so was their service.",7
That you for your prompt intervention on the list of my order. It came and all is well. Such customer service is hard you find. Then you.,7

Overall service was good.Easy to get and receive status updates.I paid extra for premium delivery and from order placement to having products on my door step was 1 week. Very reasonable.,7
"The service was good, but I am not sure what to do with the products that didn't work.There wasn't a return receipt and there were no directions given to me when I emailed about the issue regarding the merchandise I originally ordered.",7
Exactly what I was looking for. Great material.,7
Just what I ordered no issues or complaints.,7
"The hoodie was good quality, the print was not.The image was small and the print blurry in some areas and clearer (but super small) in others.",7

Right now its the only company where I can order what i want they have a variety of everything,7
"Great Tee, love the design and so relevant in this age. Two thumbs up",7
"Great mug but expensive for what it is, as the postage to the UK almost doubles the cost.",7
"This is my first time to order from the is company. The order design was nice and exactly what I wanted, but somehow the sizing was way off. But, they are doing everything they can to get the order corrected.",7

"As advertised.The shirts I ordered were high quality, and shipped quickly.",7
"I ordered a large t-shirt. Although the lable says ""L"" I'd be hard pressed to say it wouldn't fit a toddler. There is no way this is an adult Large! I sent a message telling them this and not one single person has reached out to make it right. I had to show up without a gift. You won't ever get me to buy another product from you and I plan to actively let people know that they shouldn't buy anything from you either. Accidents happen. Not making it right...that's not an accident. It's poor customer service. There's no excuse for that.",7
I gave you three stars because your woman's t-shirts are made horrible (not what's printed on them the fit). I had to ask for an xl when I received it I had the same issue with the large one. The top of shirt is too tight! When I received the xl the top was the same as the large but the bottom half was huge! You have to understand that women are built bigger in the chest area hello.Other then that your customer support and all your designs are amazing!,7
"when the examples of the size of the shirts are shown on the models, that is very helpful on determining the size i needed to order, some shirt sizes vary from one to another at times in orders from other venders. the printing quality looks good and the shirts seem to be of good quality.",7
Excellent productfast shipping,7
"Like the different selections,,great job!!",7
Likes thisShirt... would order more,7
"Tee Public went out of its way regarding customer satisfaction. The t shirt that was first ordered was too small. After making contact with them on how to proceed to exchange for a larger size, they replied saying they would send another in size large...and to just keep the original. This was such an unexpected surprise. Both t shirts are great quality too!! Totally a 5 star experience!!",7
The products are superior. The communication regarding delivery was better than any I've experienced. I loved the idea of supporting independent artists and found this company outstanding. TeePublic will definitely get my business in the future. Well done!!,7

I ordered 2 shirts.One of which looks amazing.It is a purple heather shirt with some Transformers on it.The quality of the graphics and the shirt are awesome.The other shirt I purchased is yellow with some hip-hop lyrics on the front.The shirt itself just ok in comparison.However the graphics look rather bad and I doubt it will last past its' 1st wash.,7

I love all the designs and that tee public supports artists. The only complaint I have is the quality of the T-shirts.I have made 4 or 5 orders and I have never gotten the same style shirt twice and it seems like with each order the quality goes down. I wish they would keep one type ofhigh quality shirt and stick with it.,7
"Art work is great!Sizing sucks, 4 x-larges 4 different sizesToo late for them to make it right shirts are washed they won't want them back I'll just have to wait till I lose a little weight to wear 2 of them. However if they want to send me a coupon for my next order I would not mind",7

the shirt came pretty quickly given the overall delay with mail deliveries + very good quality print! the colors are vibrant & look exactly like the photo :),7
Quality work at great price. Love the colors of the t-shirts and the art work is great. Fast delivery with no problems.,7
The shirts run VERY small so order at least one size larger than you need. This is for both men's and ladies. Also one of the shirts has random spots of discoloration.They are inexpensive so you get what you pay for and that's fine.,7

"Having just visited the state of Wisconsin I wanted a tee shirt with a chunk of cheese on it.I could not find such a shirt during our travels.My husband went online and found TeePublic.The envisioned shirt was there.The shirt was ordered and within a few days we had tracking info with the shipper, USPS.Somehow the shirt went astray while enroute.I called TeePublic to order a replacement. Not only did I get a t-shirt with a hunk of cheese but I think every person in the Customer Service dept. contacted me with updates.I needed to get a different shirt due availability and it was $4 more.Not only did they replace the shirt but waived the additional charge.Yes, I was overwhelmed with the service.I'll definitely be a repeat customer.",7

Really happy with shirts but both were the wrong size,7
The shirts I received were not clearly printed and they were low resolution for a reprint. The shirts arrived with a strong chemical smell and even after contacting customer service there was no resolution after 5 days. I would recommend shopping on amazon when they accept return and immediately issue refunds when products are defective.,7
My friend loved the shirt I send her and the order came pretty quick than I expected,7
"Ordering and shipping were great but the quality of the t-shirt material doesn't seem to be.I should have chosen the super soft but in the past when I've done this with other companies, the shirts didn't last long.We'll see how this one holds up and washes.",7

I loved the shirt I bought. I will definitely be ordering again soon.,7
It was a nice jacket the artwork was amazing and it felt nice to wear but after a couple washes the artwork started to rub off and it became loose maybe it was the type of detergent that was used I'll leave at a four possibly due human error.,7

Great fit and very soft.They suggested purchasing a size larger and it fit perfectly.I appreciate this because sometimes I buy an XL from other venders and it is way too big and other times I purchase an XL and it is too small.I love the very soft fabric.The is the problem that I also have with other venders.The fabric is ruff and scratchy with no stretch.Love the old school Astros logo!Go Astros!,7

Nice design. Pretty fast delivery. No problems at all.,7

"Speed of delivery, excellent quality, very impressed",7
the shirt i ordered was overpriced and the design was kind of faded. never again will i pay 30+ for a crappy shirt like that,7
Clothes run one to 2 sizes smaller than published.,7
Good quality and fair price with a wide variety to choose from.,7
The pin I ordered was the size of my thumb nail. It didn't say Kristi Noem is my hero.The pin is so small the face is barely discernable and it cost $6 to ship. You couldn't put it in an envelope and mail it for50cents?,7
"The design is worth 5 stars. It���������s exactly what I chose and wanted. The problem is the print quality is low. It seems like you were diluting the ink or not using enough.Aside from that, the sweatshirt material is fine and the ",7
Shirt is as described and graphic looks nice. Fit is true and fabric is soft. Shipping was a little delayed but that was most likely due to the 2020 holiday shipping madness. Very satisfied with the purchase and the artist!,7
My boyfriend loves the shirt. Big Monty Fan,7
"I ordered a ladies medium, and it���������s tiny. Literally an extra small. I just ordered it again in a larger size, trying to send it back after paying the $20 shipping is annoying. The shirt is good quality, also ordered a coffee mug, it���������s nice. Once the new shirt gets here in the larger size, I will mot use the site again. Ridiculous to have to pay for shipping, and shorts need to be sized appropriately. A good idea, but can improve greatly. The shirt was a gift, and I was embarrassed to give thing shirt that came to a teen. Lots of reviews say this, don���������t keep annoying cust",7
The shirts smelled like vinegar right out of the bag. One person liked his shirt the other said poor quality but no one like the way it came smelling.Did ship on time though.,7
Design was not centered on one of the two shirts I ordered.,7
Sizing is nowhere close to being accurate. Love the designs but will be first time last time shopping at TP,7
The coffee cup that I received was great. The one thing that I had thought of is if the emblem was on both sides of the coffee cup instead of just one side.,7
Nice looking tshirts but I wish you would use Gildan brand. The shirts I got are alittle small in the arms but overall they are good. P,7
Love the shirt I received... Very well made..,7

The shirt I ordered wasn't accurate on the pictures.,7
"Everything was great with this purchase! I ordered four t-shirts and I was very happy with the quality of the material, they're better then most others I have bought online. The print was well done too, there were no imperfections or blochiness as with other companies I have purchased from online. I love unique t-shirts and am always buying online when I see a cool design or a retro band. This was my first order from TeePublic, but it won't be my last.",7
Great first experience! One of the ladies shirts was too small and it was a hassle free great experience to order correct size.,7

Ordering was very easy and my item even arrived early :),7
The men shirtsI ordered were very nice butthe size was more like an XL than a 2XL. Still my husband could wear them.However the 2XL women's shirt I ordered was more like a medium. I really wanted a women's shirt and not a man style size. That really bummed me out as I loved the shirt.,7

Was just what my granddaughter wanted looks just as photo,7
All 3 of the tshirts I ordered were way too small. I ordered adult Mens and womenswear shirts and they would probably fit an 8 year old child! I used the charts they provide and I ordered accordingly. You can���������t even call customer service! Email only. I was so excited I found this company because they offer unique options. You can only return something if they deem it defective! I give t,7

Amazing ! Very cute !,7
Not as bright od colors like I wanted but she will look cute in anything she puts on. 12 months onesie Lake Girl pink,7
I love TeePublic and all their designs. My only comment for improvement is I'd like to be able to search by designer and their store name. Also would like to be able to access all the stores I follow from my account page.,7
Experience was great. My husband loves the shirt!,7
"The t-shirt I received has a fake sparkle it is definitely not a glitter transfer. It is even blurry!Also, you may have stamped it a 3XL but it is definitely a size medium. I am totally not happy with this product.",7
Tshirt fabric is very flimsy and the shirt has a hole in it.,7
I like the way the shirt is made. It is easy to see the picture on the shirt and the overall quality is very high.,7

"This website is so professional and customer friendly. I ordered several shirts and got them very speedily, unfortunately they were a size to small and I was dreading trying to exchange them. However they made the exchange super quick and easy and even encouraged me to donate or reuse the ones that didn���������t fit. I will recommend this company to anyone. The quality of the sh",7

"I've bought a lot of shirts from this company. Pretty solid service and quality. The last batch I bought had some thin spots in the ink, but overall they do a great job with a ton of choices in design. I'll buy from them again. Waiting for the sale to come around is a bit of a pain but you do save some money. Not perfect but pretty darn good.",7
Shirts came just as promised and quickly!Great material and quality.,7
I like the fit of my Chapter 55 tee shirt and I received it 2 days early!,7
"What a fantastic selection of creative artistry is offered through this company! There is definitely something for everyone from serious to silly. The workmanship of the two shirts I purchased was really awesome - the colors were what I had hoped for and the printing was perfectly placed. I would also add that the purchase price is very reasonable for a custom order. Two recommendations: Although my order did arrive before Christmas, getting notified of a delay of delivery did add to the already stressful preparationso make sure to order early enough to avoid that. Also, I found the shirt sizes run small (both men and women's) and would suggest going up a size. Having said that, the company clearly wants customer satisfaction and goes out of the way to encourage it. Unfortunately, I wasn't in a position to get the size problem corrected. Would I order again? Yes - the quality of the product and followup of the company is impressive. Being careful to follow my own advice, I will definitely be a return customer.",7
Goods arrived in good condition and in good time.Very pleased.,7
I had ordered the wrong size on one of the shirts I purchased and reached out for help. Within minutes I was contacted and the issue was resolved. Great customer service.,7
"Great selection! We placed an order for Christmas, and I must have put the wrong size by mistake.They not only answered immediately but replaced the order for me.",7
Sizes run a little small but customer service was amazing about helping get another tshirt .,7

"I had no problems. Good service, quick.",7
Immediate correction of size upgrade without any questions or hassle.Love the shirt and great customer service.,7
The graphics were not fully transferred to both items ordered. Will not be wearing these in public.,7
"Product was what I expected, and it came on time.",7
Design is great. The shirt however is Bella+Canvas which cuts very small and is thin and almost see through. Would love to know the brand of T-shirt before I buy next time. Whenever I order a shirt online and then I get it in the mail and I see that long thin tag in the back I know it���������s not going to fit. I���������m not sure I can wear this to ,7
"I have placed several orders with TeePublic and will continue to be a regular customer. The sheer number of designs is hard to ignore. The quality of their shirts is very high and the price is just right. They even have sales of up to 30% off perhaps every other month. I love that you can specify what color the designs are printed on, sometimes having 24 or so to choose from. Because they are made to order, shirts usually ship 3 or 4 days after an order is placed, and arrive about 5 to 7 days later. One thing I have not done yet is to have a design put on another item, like a mug or a tapestry. I will have to check that out in the coming year. Big thumbs up for this company, though!",7
"My parcel was not delivered - the tracking no. mentions that delivery was attempted twice!We are open the whole day between 07.00 and 18.00 - we did not see any sign of your logistics company, nor was I contacted to say there were issues with delivery.Poor service",7

I got exactly what I ordered and the quality is amazing! The price point was perfect and it got to me rather quickly. DEFINITELY recommend!,7
TeePublic sent my items quickly and they arrived in excellent condition.The only reason that I did not give 5 stars is that one item had a background of the states that can hardly be seen at all.Anyone who could see it would have to beinches away-certainly not visible if social distancing.The other items were very nice.,7
Easy to maneuver around the website. Order arrived earlier than anticipated which was great.,7
"Supper slow delivery times, placed order 3 weeks ago still waiting, never again",7
My 13 year old autistic daughter has very random & hard to find character obsessions but I was able to find several different Happy Tree Friends t-shirts that I know she is going to love!,7
"Ordered my t-shirt on May 25th, didn���������t arrive until early July (and I had to contact TeePublic twice to ask them why my package wasn���������t moving in the tracking process). It was suspicious that it was only after they would respond that the package would move from the location that it had been sitting at for 7+ days (but correlation doesn���������t necessarily equal causation). When I did finally receive my t-shirt, they did refund me my ~$6 shipping charge, but for a $30, this kind of service isn���������t really worth it. It says that it takes 5-25 business days to get a shirt, which is a huge variation in time (but you are getting a fresh design, so...), but they also have horrible customer service response time. However, the one agent who seemed to take time to listen and respond to my concerns about why my shirt was taking over a month (business days, keep in mind, not just a normal month), was very nice and accommodatingrdered my shirt during the COVID-19 crisis, so that could severely impact my experience, but according to other people who have ordered from them, this has been a reoccurring issue with them. I won���������t say not to order from them, but I certainly order from them (especially since my shirt smells heavily of vinegar, something that I���������m struggling to get out)... The quality of the shirt is actually really nice! The design is beautiful, the print is lovely. The material of the shirt isn���������t really what I expected, but that���������s okay, it���������s still nice! It does run smaller than what���������s expected, so please keep that in mind if you do choose to order.Could these shipping issues be chalked up to being issues with COVID? Possibly! But with everything else that occurred during the process and everyone else���������s issues with TeePublic, I highly doubt it. Iter COVID passes or until after business have a while to adjust to new business practices in this new COVID world...",7
The first shirt ordered was too small. Company said I could keep it and sent a free replacement. Couldn���������t ,7

"I purchased 7 of the men's classic tees with various designs. Women's tees are usually too short for me. I LOVE every one of them. They fit great and are so soft. I was worried the print was going to be that super thick stuff but it's not. The colors of the actual tee shirts are great as well, especially the heathered colors. These are hands down my new favorite tees and I can't wait to buy more. I do wish there was a way to mark favorites while looking through the designs. If there is one I apologize I may of missed it.",7

Poor low quality fabric ( t-shirt) with heavy inked printing . Material very thin and not quality . Tried to return and told I must pay return postage. This is not fair. I expected for the price the quality of the product would be at least substantial.,7

Great customer service explaining everything on the website however this was a gift and the receiver of the gift told me when asked that the cotton quality of the T-shirt was thin. Nobody likes thin t-shirts so I guess I should have ordered the heavy cotton but who would know that?,7

"The onesie is very cute, but has a horrible smell. I���������m hoping it come",7
I ordered a Moana shirt for my husband. The shirt quality was average and the print was ridiculous. The crab was off centered and had bubbles everywhere. Almost like the shirt was folded over on itself while it was still wet and then pulled apart after it dried. Will never use teepublic again especially after what they charged for this very poor product.,7

"I was charged four times for the one single order I placed. Then the order took over 3 weeks for delivery. Lastly, the sizes are wayyyy off from what the size charts show. Luckily they fit just enough for us to still be able to wear them. I will not be ordering from this company again.",7

I've recently ordered 3 t-shirts from 3 different designers. The quality of fabric and the quality of print was outstanding (not to mention the originality and the uniqueness of the design). The delivery was fast and the communication re. delivery excellent. Well done TeePublic! You now have a regular customer here:)TomMelbourne (Australia),7
One shirt was OK. The graphics on the other shirt were already faded. 50/50 experience,7
"Usually the printing is good quality, but this batch was not great. The printing on one of the shirts was off to the side instead of in the middle of the shirt. Also, the printing was starting to come off a little. The other shirt had no issues.",7
My package said it was delivered to my home and I never received it.,7
"Teepublic is my favorite site for tees, I always prefer the Gildan heavy tees because they fit so nicely and are thick and rugged. The prints are always clean on the shirts as well.",7
"i love the tees i ordered. all of them are stylized band-based fanart creations that are skillfully silkscreened; unlike some other cheap plastic heat transfer-type tees i have ordered from other sites recently. Customer service is excellent, with immediate updates and notifications. Shipping was on-time as described. i was offered an excellent promotional deal as well. Huge selection from a very talented pool of artists. Will be buying again.",7

Loved the variety that these guys offer. I found exactly what I was looking for and am pleased with my order. Delivery was prompt. Happy customer!,7
Design is beautiful and the shirt is great quality,7
Shirt was as expected. The shipping charges are high considering free shipping offered by most online vendors these days. Ended up costing $30 plus.,7
I ordered a few shirts and unfortunately one had black printing which did not show up on the charcoal background. Teepublic was kind enough to replace the shirt with a different color. This was all done very quickly. My only complaint is that there are not more color choices in the curvy sizes.,7
I ordered a sweatshirt that came in and fit too small. They resent me a new one a size bigger and let me keep the original one they sent. Very good customer service and I love the designs!,7
"I placed Ann order for Camel back Mountain tank top and pins or my friend and I.This was a surprise gift for my friend as we recently visited Arizona and Camelback.I ordered size small as we are both petite, but when the shirts arrived they were a bit too small.I emailed customer service on a Sunday and received an immediate response that they had shipped a larger size at no cost!I was delighted as I planned to surprise my friend with the shirt and pin as a Christmas gift.I would recommend this company and will order their merchandise in the future.",7

"Customer service is always quick, friendly and aims to find a resolution. The products are quirky and fun and team is great!",7
"The design of the shirt was great but the material of the shirt itself was very poor as it���������s super thin. The placement of the design is also a little off of where the picture placed it, being a lot lower than expected. Great designs but poor shirt",7
I really hope the t-shirt fits.. it is a Christmas present. The medium ladies looks like a ladies small. That is the only complaint I have.,7

Have ordered from TeePub several time and have always love the shirts and the quality.,7
The lettering on my mOTivate shirt is crooked! It moves upward from right to left. Can't/won't wear it.,7
I received the tee very quickly. It was in great shape when it arrived. It's soft and the printwork is good. I'm giving it as a Christmas gift to my nephew so I don't know how well it will fit him or hold up to washing. This is my first purchase through TeePublic so I'm hoping he will like it and it fits and wears well.,7
I love my tee shirts!Going to get more soon. Supporting artists is fantastic!,7
Love the shirts! I bought one for my dad and one for myself. The fabric feels good and the fit is nice. My only complaint is that the dye is very strong when you open the package. I would recommend washing prior to wearing.,7
"The t-shirt is true to size but the print isn���������t great. The yellow tone is far too dominant so much of the print is too similar in colour (especially where there should be a paler colour in the background of the Pulp Fiction insert to make it pop a little more (you want to see the point to the insert after all!)). I love the design idea, just no",7
Amazing quality and a variety of graphics..love you guys!,7

"The product was as I anticipated , lovely.however knowing that Teepublic uses the USPS I will never order anything else through you. I tracked the package and it showedit had reached McKinney., the Fairview post office five miles from me.and then it was sent back toTN.WHAT?.I tried reaching Teepeople. No response. I tried the USPSNo response I even filed a dispute.Then the day before the person receiving the gift was to leave on vacation I received TEN. Text messages and the package arrived.",7
"This shirt was great,however the print didn't come out as dark as I thought it would,it was a little faded with specs of missing print. But it still fit nice and I was able to wear it, I'm just not sure how many washes it will take before the print is gone.",7
The Olive Knight! Such a great artist! His designs on quality tees is why I like Tee Public. TOK! TheOliveKnight,7

"Although the design and material were as nice as expected, the theoretically 'Large' T-shirt was way too small, and the recipient can't use it. In fact no one in our family can use it. Sizing completely off.",7
The products that I received were not as described. I could have printed the images better myself at home. The notebook that I bought just had a paper cover glued to to the actual cover and it wasn���������t glued well. I also purchased stickers that were ���������supposed�������,7
"Priced right, arrived quickly. Hope the art stays on!",7
Fantastic customer service and great products.,7
Unfortunately I purchased four berserk shirts that I desperately wanted and they are arrived with a printing error. Tee public sent me four new shirts free of charge however three of four of them again came with the improper printing color. Instead of getting what I ordered I was now told to order four new shirts that I didn���������t really want simply to fulfill the order. I do not understand why they can���������t simply print out the shirts in the right manner. Otherwise why attempt to sell and make items that will not sa,7

We had a two issues with our order.The first shipment was one shirt short!

Great quality.Shipped on time.,7
Shirts sizes fit differently could have used a bigger size,7
"I am so happy with my purchase from Teepublic that I have already ordered again. The delivery wast faster than expected and all quality was up to my standards or surpassed. Their t-shirts are much better than even expected. The material is soft, comfortable and washed extremely well. The fit is on the small side, so I did order a size up and is perfect. The stickers are also great quality. The designs on some of the stickers are a little less than perfect. The colors are slightly faded on some and a little pixely on the black. However, I did not return or regret purchases. Overall I will definitely order again and recommend their site and products.",7
I order 2 orange flintstones Afro American shirts for my Babyshower I received them 3days ago & the babies are trump orange and looks like they were running out of ink and continued to process orders instead of changing ink ������������this is not what I order and have been contacting the company for another but now I would like my money back and they can have these shirts !!! I strongly feel like they should take a picture of shirts they have done and post them not what they supposed to look like cause it���������s not,7
The shirt is beautiful. Exactly what I wanted,7
Your product came in blurry and faded. Nothing was true to size.,7
Love this T-Shirt! Ruth is my favorite on Ozark . Glad I went up a size the shirt runs small.,7

Quality of shirts is very good. Customer service was very prompt and helpful in answering my questions.,7
"The shirts are great, but I still have not had my account restored . I simply bought shirts that I designed, and it said I had somehow violated community guidelines. I have brought this up multiple times to the legal department and haven't received a word back. I will miss out on the seasonal discount because I can't order my shirts from my account. So no, not satisfied.",7
"Love the variety of slogans, sarcasm, topics of all the tshirts... however, they are very pricey for a regular tshirt... ordered 3...one I ordered in the ""premium"" material whereas the other 2 were simply the ""classic""... material is the same on all 3...nothing ""premium"" whatsoever so why did I pay more?...all in all, it would be very hard to find some of these ""sayings"" on a tshirt so the excessive cost is up to the buyer I guess...that given, I am still happy with my purchase as a whole.",7
"Very affordable, quality items, great customer service!",7
"All the shirts I've purchased have arrived on time and in good shape. I've patronized this shop for years, and have never been disappointed.",7

"Large selection, decent quality of shirts. It would be nice to have sizes available.",7
"I ordered 2 shirts, great proce and received them very quickly even in the Christmas rush. Once I received them I realized the sizing was not going to work. I reached out right away but bc this was a present they needed to mail the replacements to a different address which they did for and made everything so easy and smooth. These are very nice quality graphic tees and you won't find better customer service.I will most definitely be purchasing from them again.",7
"My order was shipped to a previous address on my account.I never noticed, since I placed an order in January which shipped to my current address.I never thought to double check as I figured the system recognized the last order I placed.I didn't bother to contact customer service because it's pretty non existent in today's world - every company only seems concerned that a positive review is posted somewhere; google, amazon, or their own proprietary system that gets used in their marketing.",7
"I was waiting to do a review, but since I haven't heard back from customer service regarding the the terrible graphic quality, TeePublic gets a 1 star out of me. It's as if the shirts have been worn for many, many years and the lettering has faded. And, it wasn't just one shirt, it was all 3 shirts. It sucks they felt the shirts were good enough to put in the bag and ship. So much for those Christmas gifts.",7
"The shirt is very soft and bright, the ink very nice. I bought this shirt for my dad for Christmas, I think he will love it.",7
Good quality and responsive customer service.,7
I ordered the wrong size for part of my sons Xmas present and I only got it a couple if days agoCan't believe how slow the postage took,7

Really love the artwork!! They came out great!!,7
"We ordered two shirts, one for me (male) and one for my wife. The shirts are very soft and comfortable, and the graphic print is the kind that does move with the shirt (no stiff spots to run uncomfortably). Not absolutely perfect though, my wife���������s shirt was folded in a way that caused a small spot in the print to stick to itself and peel off. It���������s small enough to be ignored; if anything, it just looks a little like normal wear over time. The tag is also one that's not terribly comfortable. It sticks out when it can, and sometimes chafes just so slightly to be annoying, but not uncomfortable. Would have preferred to have that i",7

Customer service was exceptional! my son received his reptar park sweater!,7
"I love the imagine (hence why I ordered it) but the size for a large is very small. I normally always order a large in shorts and they fit with room to move around, not snug. I maybe should have read the reviews. Hopefully this review will help others. I might just have to cut the shirt and frame the image.. very unhappy and not wanting to wait(again) for return, refund,and reorder.",7
"Cool products, nice fit! Tried to order a lightweight sweatshirt but they didn't have anymoer in stock. The customer service contacted me almost immediately and let me choose an altenative. I would've given them 5 stars but I was looking forward to the lightweight seatshirt. Would still order from them again",7
"We rec'd our shirt and found it was too small. Called the company and we were told to donate the small shirt. We were instructed to go back on their website and order a larger size. We did, and promptly rec'd a new shirt, NO CHARGE! Can't beat that for great customer service. We'll be ordering from them in the future.",7
My wife loved the tee but the large fit more like a medium but was still satisfied with the delivery and everything,7

"My experience with TeePublic demonstrated they lack quality control for what it printed and the options offered. The mug I ordered for example: I used a design on the TeePublic site. The printing was so dark that the wording was illegible. Clearly, no one is proofing items before they are shipped. When I voiced my concern I was informed all sales are final and the graphic printed as intended and was correct. Despite the fact the images and words were so dark they could not be read. Waste of money and time. Had to to buy a gift elsewhere from a business that actually cares. Do NOT recommend.",7

"I will not order from TeePublic ever again. I ordered 2 adult medium sweatshirts on May 17th, 2020. The sweatshirts were not shipped until June 9th. Ok. They were shipped from Cranbury, NJ and were suppose to be delivered to Manhattan - 1 hour away. But it turns out the label was created on June 9th. They didn't get to UPS until June 10th. Then the package travelled to Avenel, NJ and stayed there from June 10th through the 14th. Then the package headed south (yep, south) to Bridgeport NJ and stayed there until June 16th. Finally, transferred to USPS and delivered on June 23rd. Packaging was 2 sweatshirts shoved as tightly as possible into a plastic mailing bag. How do you fit 2 adult medium sweatshirts into 1 small mailing bag? Well, when the sweatshirts are really adult SMALL and cheap quality (I paid $50 for each sweatshirt), yeah, you can shove them into a small bag.So, in summary: poor ordering experience, horrible shipping and equally bad quality sweatshirts. Hence, will never order from TeePublic again.",7
The shirt and design were exactly what I was expecting. It shipped within the timeline they gave with no delays. Excellent product and service.,7
Great product. Fast shipping.,7
The artist is AWESOME,7

"I returned 3 of the 10 masks because the lowermost line of writing was obscured by the hem being sewn over it.I was thinking that the person sewing the hem on those particular masks should have reported to a manager that the outcome was unacceptable. But I guess in the scheme of things that will never happen.One other issue that affects all the masks is that they are all just a bit too small to work effectively on an adult face, mainly because they slip down off the nose too easily.",7
"My grandson loved the shirt I purchased from TeePublic.It is very much like his dad's shirt, and he feels so grow up.The quality of the fabric is excellent.The design is exactly what he wanted.",7

The shirts arrived in great time and were even better than I expected! Great material and the sizes were spot on!,7
Have bought many times without any issues. The one time I got a torn shirt they sent a new one (reprint) without any hesitation. Great folks The shirts are also nice and are a better value when on the 35% off sale. None of the prints have failed or washed off so far (some are 2 years old),7
I love the shirt except it is too small. I'm a size 14 and ordered an xxl. I wanted to sleep in it. It fits just right but I think the sizing is off.,7
Very fast delivery. My son loves his new tshirt,7
The shirt I received is defective I emailed them and it took a week to get back to me and when he finally did he ask me if I washed it and I answered him and i still haven't heard from them and that was like 3 weeks ago I spent almost $30 and I got a defective shirts,7
"Easy fast transaction, prompt delivery",7
The times that I have had to contact customer serviceI get the help that I need and all my needs are met! I always love the shirts that I get.The only thing that I'm not a huge fan of is the shipping cost that's why I buy even i have more than 1 shirt in mind or when there are sales.,7
I'm pretty sure I clicked on wrong product by accident but teePublic didn't hesitate or give me issues they said keep the shirt you got in error and the right one is ON US ! great customer service !,7
the size looks about right the color is good but when I took the shirt out of the package it had a terrible chemical smell,7

Quick delivery alot of opinions. I can spend hours looking for cool shirts i cant find no where else.,7
"easy interface, nice products, superb customer service for designers.",7
Customer service for teepublic is awful or should I say non-existent. The tanks are 2xl but run short. The all cotton is actualy more true to size than the expensive tricolor tanks. I thought if I paid more it would be a better quality. As for the prints they aren't bad but definately thin. Prob will last about 15-20 washes as long as I let them air dry.,7
All my masks are excellent and got a lot of compliments !!,7
Great store. So many amazing artists. Lots of variety of genres. Good quality products. 5 stars!,7
I ordered a LFGM hoodie and found the quality of the hoodie was excellent.What amazes me more than that was their return policy.I was having trouble with sizing but each time I received the hoodie and it was either too small or too big they replaced the hoodie but did not ask me to return the wrong sized one.They said to donate it or give it to someone that would fit into it.That saved me the hassle of wrapping and returning the item.I will continue to order from TeePublic.You should too!,7

My brother-in-law just purchased a 1970 Chevy Nova. It is red. I saw the exact car on a T-shirt on your website so I ordered it for him for his birthday. He absolutely loves the shirt! I only took about a week for him to get it after I ordered it.,7

The third party that handles the shipping could not handle the workload during the holidays and my order arrived later than scheduled. A customer service rep responded to my email on Sunday the day after Christmas to apologize for the inconvenience and refund the shipping fee. That is going beyond for your customers. Kudos to TeePublic!,7

"Teepublic is awesome! I had to make a return to exchange for size and customer service was terrific! They contacted me by email personally, shipped out another shirt before I'd even actually spoken with them and corresponded back and forth with me over the time it took to get the replacement. I love that they encourage people to donate or reuse items. Obviously Teepublic is an environmentally and community conscious organization, which I just love!",7

Now, it didn���������t get here for Christmas but I was able to show him what he was going to receive. The second hoodie came and it fit perfect and he loved it! Thank you ever so much.

The only thing was I ordered 2 of two different shirts and though they give you the option of changing our order, I couldn't decrease or increase my quantity, could only delete or add items.

"THEY WERE FANTASTIC!!!!The quality of some of the images on the shirts I ordered looked rushed (ordered during christmas sale, thats probably why).Got a hold of them asked for refund and took pictures.To remedy this, they sent me new shirts of the same kind that were higher quality print - FOR FREE, NO SHIPPING.This fixed the issue with a couple of them except for 1.It wasn't their fault, the artists drawing just looks meh when its blown up and stretched on a shirt so I told them I wanted that one refunded.They instead asked me to just pick another shirt that I liked and they'd sent me that one for free.I sent a screenshot of my cart that I was planning to order in the future and I circled the one I wanted as a replacement.Not only did they send me the shirt, they sent me a sticker that i was looking to buy that I didnt even talk to them about, they just offered to send it.New shirt turned out great, they let me keep my duplicates too.This is my new go to place to shop for shirts in LARGER sizes (4XL), these parody shirts are soo funny too, I get compliments all the time and I love these shirts!",7
My order arrived within the promised time frame and all the shirts were very nice quality and design. Everyone loved them.,7

Spot on shirt. But they made it right.I got a new shirt and no spots!:),7
"They are really trying to resolve my issues.However it's mostly my fault.Don't assume the medium shirt you have been wearing your whole life is going to fit.There sizing is all over the place between quality level of shirt.Read there sizing charts with a fine tooth comb.As a Canadian buyer it's very expensive. Not worth it and quality is borderline for the price.Artwork, silkscreen are great. Hurray for the artists.It's too bad.Will never buy one again for this company.Disappointed customer.",7
Longer than normal processing and shipping.,7
Great service. I made a mistake with the size of shirts I ordered and was truly impressed by the way they handled the issue. I was sent the right size shirts immediately.,7
Love the designs and t shirt options but a little more effort needs to be placed in actual printing of the shirt...crack and come off after minimal washes...love supporting the artists but the quality of the final product is lacking! I have two shirts now and will be hesitant to buy more,7
Got the first one today its good looking shirt nice quality not to happy on the red on the shirt but love the design,7
Love the tshirt material. Love that the print doesn���������t fade. The only thing you have to remember is watch the sizing. I���������m usually an XL but with theses T-s,7

"I received an order that I wanted for a Christmas party for this Friday. My husband and I both ordered tshirts. Both came two sizes too small. I emailed requesting an overnight and exchange.. after having to change Tshirt styles, then the colors didn't work for the style I wanted. There was over 13 emails exchanged. The customer service reps KNEW these shirts come small. It was a monumental waste of money and time. I will never be purchasing another thing from you all & will certainly tell others about this.",7
Great shirts.Loved the selections. Good shipping. Looking forward to shopping here again.,7
"I bought a women's XL, it came way too small. It was a Christmas gift. More like a small or medium",7
"I was really impressed when I received the BD-1 Travel Mug I ordered as a gift for my wife. I was nervous when we opened it together (I hadn't seen the final result yet!). But I was honestly VERY IMPRESSED. Everything was perfect. Alyssa Bradley from whimsydesignandillustration.com did an amazing design, and TeePublic printed it perfectly onto the Travel Mug. Thank you for a great product!",7
"As always, I love the shirts I ordered from you.Awesome graphics, great shirt quality.My daughter absolutely loved the ""Stuff"" movie t-shirt i got her.Already have had tons of compliments on both our shirts.",7
I had ordered a size medium for ladies.It was too small.Company offered to send bigger size and I did not have to return the first.what a great way to do business!Very easy,7
Service is fine. I just wish there was a way to see past orders.,7
Amazing service! Quick response. Will definitely order from them again.,7
Great products and service.I bit high on price.,7
"Product was as expected.Ordering was difficult because the site would appear to reject the credit card I used, so I would start over.In the end, I had multiple orders.The customer derive people cancelled the duplicates once I contacted them.",7
This is my second time ordering from TeePublic. Like the designs and the tees are nice. Would prefer the thicker NL shirts (what I thought I was getting) as opposed to the thinner Canvas shirts. But good quality nonetheless. Will order again,7
Horrible quality.and feel shirt is hard material..small fittingI got the size I always wear.....do not want another shirt it doesn't feel good quality The material.is rough not soft.,7
It said to order a size up in one tee I bought and it fits perfectly the stickers are great too!,7

Great! Simply great!,7
"Fast, quick and exceptionally great customer service.",7
"Very good quality.My only complaint is that the print is a bit too difficult to read against the black background (very small and thin, the color not contrasted enough).",7
The shirts are darling and the company works hard to please but the sizing is off. I first ordered my size and too small. They made new ones and suggested the slouchy fit. Neck was big & the sleeve was tight and fabric not the best,7
"Love the shirts. Great quality and shipping was fast. However, they do run VERY small.",7
"I received shirt exactly as ordered & in a reasonable amount of time... , also packaged with care...",7
"Excellent customer service. My package was lost twice in the mail and they send a replacement right away, to make it before Christmas.",7
Fast delivery. Got the product within days.,7
Design and Print look exactly as they did while ordering. Fit is great as well. I'm happy that I chose the tri-blend option. Extremely comfortable.,7
Looked like a great shirt on their webpage. When I got it the printing was illegible as the t-shirt was darker than ordered. Image was also smaller than shown on the webpage. Would not have ordered if I had known this. 50 dollar t-shirt and they could not even look at it before sending?They did send another shirt. Not the color I wanted but acceptable. Seems to be some quality control issues. Order with caution. Updated to 3 stars.,7
"I love ordering T shirts & things because you have such a great selectionof designs. I have ordered several times. Twice the sizes were not a great fit. I may hesitate to order in the future because of the sizing. When the shirt is too small, it's not gift worthy.",7
I loved the t shirts from them. Fit great and in the color i ordered. Well done,7
Tee public is awesome they allow me to express myself righteously so May God continue to bless this company.,7
My shirts came in quicker than expected ! The quality was fantastic and the sizing was accurate.,7

We order our Christmas shirts from here every year,7
"Great experience shopping with the site. The selection and options available were plentiful. My only issue was the sizing of the womens t shirts, but that had nothing to do with the site, its more to do with how society determines how a female���������s shirt should look compared to a male���������s. I���������m a plus size girl and dont like a form fitting tshirt. For fut",7

I recently purchased a toddle tshirt and a mug with the same print on them. My mug arrived broken and without any trouble TeePublic replaced my mug. Quality of the replacement was great and the tshirt was an excellent quality once received.,7
Kinds bs that I paid almost 20 a shirt and none of them fit and you guys won't give a refund. I don't want them exchanged because they won't be here in time.,7

"My order was timely and mostly of good quality. Because I ordered a substantial number of items, the shipment was broken into two. The first order was perfect. The second order came with different brand tank tops that were not as soft or as high qualifyas the first order. (Belle/canvas vs Gildan) I am not sure if this a coincidence or not but the items in the second order were scratchy and poorly fitting in comparison to the first shipment.",7

I was expecting the doomguy picture to be pixilated as this is hkw it looks like originally But the design on the shirt it pixilated too much and the features can not be appreciated up close. It only becomes discernable 3 feet away.Picture should've been smaller not occupying the whole front of the shirt so pixels become smaller and more obvious up close,7

Fabric is nice . Graphics are as shown on the website . I am pleased with my order.,7
I like the quality of the art application.Sizing was great.I just miss the days of substantial fabric.The lightweight spun cotton blends are not durable and don't feel like they are protective or long lifed.I have tees that are excellent design and 20 years old.The new basic shirts are obviously cheaper made and imported. I don't expect to be wearing them in 4-5 years.Feeling cheated.,7

I have to rate this company a a low as I can. Reason is I have not received my item and contacting the company is the most insane thing I think I have ever experienced.How can a legimate company not have a telephone number in order tosolve any issuesa customer might have?No customer should have this kind of experience.,7

"Terrible service, Terrible packaging terrible delivery. If i knew 10-15 days was a month and a half for delivery, i would���������ve not bought them and just made these simple ass shirts myself. I understand shipping is different because of Covid but in no sense was i ever emailed because of it. Instead i had to assume and send out an email after you guys emailed me saying my package would come on time. Lies, bad service and communication. $90 for 4 shirts to come together in mail packaging but the shirts weren���������t even covered in any sort of plastic or paper to protect them from anything. Btw, the shirts are light which is cool, but I���������m iffy about it being ripped or worn out in the future. Says a",7
Graphic on my tee is fuzzy/not as pictured when I ordered. The t-shirt is nice.,7
I am still waiting on 2 shirts. I inquired as to why tracking information was not available and have still not recieved an answer.,7
Tee-public always provides quality shirts. Have bought several over the years and never a complaint.,7
I really liked the shirt and would give 5 stars had there not been an issue with shipping the shirt out. I ordered on July 3rd and waited 9 business days and still hadn't gotten a tracking number or notice of the tshirt being shipped. I emailed the company and they did refund my shipping costs. I will order again in the future,7
Everything came very quickly and as expected. I was very impressed with a company I had never used before.,7
Hoddies are great and exacly what I ordered. The plus size seemed to slim down from the shoulder so it is not wearable for the person it was purchased for.,7
This company made return easy and were very courteous,7
My order was quickly processed and shipped and the shipping was fast and efficient. The product is of good quality and should last years also love the huge selection.,7
Just as pictured. Fabric was thin and could have been higher quality. Pleased with purchase.,7

"Everything I received was great and better than expected! I was missing a shirt in my order, I contacted them right away and they fixed the problem and I got my shirt rather quickly!!",7
I had a great experience ordering from Teepublic. My shirt is great and the print is exactly as I expected... Also this may just be because I know it shipped from relatively close to me but I placed my order Tuesday night and received it Friday morning which is way shorter than I would expect from what I think must be a print on demand service.,7
"Quality material and printing, sizing is a little off. One too large, one too small",7
Tri-blend option is very comfortable,7
"Your products are truly unique and I can find them on your site when I can find them no where else. Your Customer Service is fantastic. My size issue was resolved efficiently and without a hassle. I have always had a little difficulty with your size charts. It would be more helpful if the children's were listed with the accompanying numerical equivalent (ie: 8-10 or 10-12). It's just really difficult to tell with the body images posted. Otherwise, all is good and I will order from this company again when the need arises!",7
"Great Experience, fast shipping!",7
The shipping/printing was fast but the image on the shirt was not crisp and sharp. The image words were slightly faded and didn���������t look like ,7
TeePublic is great! Purchased two tshirts and they turned out perfect���������well except they were a bit snug but that wasn���������t their fault. I should have gone with my guy and gone 1 size up.

Stunning design and great quality. Will be ordering again super happy!,7
I wanted to surprise my friend who left Chicago last year for his home state of Massachusettes. I was looking to find something that would bring a little bit of 'Chi' to him for his birthday since we couldn't celebrate together. I ordered 2 vintage tshirts and had them delivered directly to him.I bought a men's large and at first when he took them out of the package he thought they looked too small. He's 6'2 & 190 lb and they ended up fitting perfectly. If he had a big belly I don't think they would have fit as well. I wanted to attach pictures but I don't see an option. These are the tshirts I decided on......**Super Bowl XX Chicago Bears v. New England Patriots **Wrigley Field Chicago Cubs marquee Save Ferris I will definitely would use TeePublic again for gift giving and for myself.,7
"Teepublicis great! They have so many unique choices, and the shirts are good quality.",7

"My shirt was exactly as pictured, and very cute!",7
"I purchased 3 shirts, two for myself and one for my husband. My husband���������s shirt was great, true to size. My shirts were a bit smaller then I expected. I am a medium normally, however I should have ordered the extra large instead of the large. Also, the screen print that I ordered is not centered on the shirt. Although, I���������m confident that if I asked, I would receive a full refund. I just look at it like it just makes it more original. I will definitely purchase mo",7
"Shirts are awesome quality is really good and delivery was super quick, will order again.",7
"I buy a lot from TeePublic. They always have outstanding customer service - any time I had an issue with an order, they always correct.Great company!",7
"Fun shirt designs, flexible sizing/styling. Timely fulfillment.",7
"Poor quality. I ordered buttons for my jean jacket and found so many relatable quotes abd vibrant colors, sadly you can barely read the buttons they are so faded and blurry",7
The graphics on the tee is outstanding but the tee it self is very stiff has a rough dry feeling like when you wash and hang on a clothing line.Go up a size.I wear a large and by mistake I order a extra large...glad I did.I'm still keeping because I can work with it.,7
Ordered a Youth XL. Received Youth L. Emailed TeePublic and they said they would replace the wrong order. Received replacement. It was a Youth L again! Ridiculous.,7

Nice selection of shirts I have not seen elsewhere.,7
Quick turnaround on shipping.Products as advertised.No problems what so ever.,7

The Peterbilt design on mask was not centered and looks horrible. If it was centered like picture when I ordered it I would love them. Big waste of money.,7
quality shirt arrived and looked as expected! very satisfied,7
Great customer service.Got back to me right away.,7
"Shirt is POOR quality. The colors are not vivid, appear faded and not distinct as shown on the picture when ordering. The color red looks almost pink-ish and the white is dull. It doesn���������t appear that any underbase was used so the black tee is absorbing a lot of the ink. I DO NOT plan on ordering any additional items in the future if this is the quality of the merchandise. Signed�����",7
Website is very similar to cafe press and other made to order sites.No lag and the amount of pictures per product was helpful in making my decision to purchase.,7
The service was incredibly helpful and quick!It was much appreciated. It will most definitely encourage me to continue to shop for unique items from TeePublic.,7

I had no issues with ordering my shirts. The process was simple.,7

Fit nicely. Daughter loves hers.,7
My package has not been delivered! It said it delivered to the wrong location. I have put in a complaint to USPS and heard nothing back so far.,7
Womens T shirts run very small! Good quality though.,7
"Easy to use website, easy to order and delivered in perfect condition. Great t shirts ����",7
My order came a lot faster than a lot of other sites. Shirt and phone case quality were surprising beyond expectation. Would definitely order from this site again.,7
"So far every shirt I've purchased from teepublic has fit pretty well. The only one I had problem with was a pink shirt, the shoulders are cut at a different angle. So far every other color I've purchased has been fine... But, I've bought shirts from other companies (like redbubble) and their shirts fit ""weird"" no matter what color they are.I've stopped buying from them completely.So any reservation I have is really based on online tshirt buying as a whole and nothing wrong with teepublic's product.",7
"Love the fit, love the art. It's a nice shirt. I will be buying more, and hopefully from the same artist in the future.",7

Always get quality products at great prices. Highly recommended to everyone. The range of artists featured on the site allow for everyone to find what they are looking for.,7
"beautiful Art, but paper-like material for the regular, and insane shipping and tax cost. I recommend it though.",7
Super wack quality of the shirt....and shirt for extra small...coulda literally bought the same shirt for less than 3 dollars... Then they turn sounds and sell it for 30 plus dollars...Will never ever order from you ever again...totally dissatisfied... Zero stars,7
Shirt was perfect. Fit was great and print was awesome. No fading after a few washes and didn't shrink. First time ordering and definitely not the last.,7
Easy to order and received exactly what we ordered and on time.,7
Great job love the shirt turned out very cute.,7
Love it it fits so good so comforting def will return for more shirts !,7
Should change the sizing charts. Womans medium fits like a child's 12/14. Overall our items were replaced with no additional fees for a size that fits. Geat company!,7
"Good T-shirt, I expected a better print of the written words, but all the other aspects are ok.",7
"Honestly every time I order from this company I never have any issues! If anything they are more than efficient and prompt with their deliveries the price you can't beat it, and I love the original artistic designs that different people are coming up with. I would love to maybe come up with some ideas as well to help Market if possible. One of the best T-shirt companies out there highly recommended! Hands down well done guys well done",7

"These t-shirts are definitely worth the money! Soft, fits perfectly! High quality product that I highly recommend!",7
Item as described. Quality product. A+ transaction.,7
The issue I have is that you never know what brand of tshirt you're going to get so the fit varies brand to brand even if it's the same logo you've purchased in the past,7
The shirt is great.It just took longer to reach me than I'd hoped it would.The part that UPS played was quick.It just got lost somewhere along the way once it was handed off to the USPS.,7
The shirts I ordered are all really nice quality and the sizing was spot on and I didn't have to wait too long for them to be delivered. Would definitely recommend Teepublic and will definitely be buying more.,7

"I've order several T-shirts this Christmas season.With covid preventing family gatherings this year, I sent out T-shirts as gifts.Tee Public has a huge selection of artisan designed shirts & sweatshirts- you just need to look through their inventory.The shirts are good quality.The other good thing at this site is that you can support individual artists.They will also let you edit designs and make your own designs. Shipping was slow over the holidays, but it was for everyone- so no fault there.Great place to shop.",7
Everything was good. My kids loved their shirts. It would be great if the womans plus size went a bit larger (even at an extra cost) The men's plus never fit like a woman's,7
Best obscure reference for The Office I've ever seen.,7
I received the t-shirt in a timely manner however the quality of the T-shirt could have been better. It looked like it was done in somebody's basement. And it had a small stain on the back.,7

The print looks okay it���������s kinda blurry and it came about 2-3 weeks late even though I paid for the fastest ship,7
Great quality tee shirt. Super fast delivery that arrived much earlier than expected.,7
Shirts were comfy. Designs were fun and colorful! Great product!,7
T-Shirts are garbage!! you can read a newspaper through them!!! What a waste of money!! I bought XL and they're smaller more like a L. I'm being 100% honest. Go to a dollar store to get the same quality!!I ordered 3 T-shirts and the whole package weighed the same as one of my T-shirts!! Flush your money down the toilet its the same!! I probably just bought T-shirts that have already been returned. It's obvious that this company has all hands on deck in the return division!!! They try to save dollars by buying garbage T-shirts to make up for lost revenues from lost sales because of the quality issues but they're killing this company further where most companies strive for quality this company strives by filling their pockets!!! STAY AWAY!!!!!!GARBAGE!!!!!,7
I love every product I���������ve gotten! The T-shirt����,7
The shirt I received looked nothing like what I was supposed to be ordering it looked very rushed & wayyy smaller will not be ordering again.,7

I ordered 2 hoodies and a tapestry. The tapestry was good. The hoodies were horrible. The graphic on the fabric looks cheap and will more than likely be unrecognizable after a couple of washes. I wouldn���������t recommend using this site if you���������re looking,7
"The shirts got here on time, fit perfectly and looked amazing!",7
TeePublic needs a reliable shipping service/method. Package has been in transient for more than a week and still has not been delivered. The product may be fine but unfortunately delivery service failed. My item was a birthday gift and the delivery missed the special occasion.,7
Both of my shirts came and I love them both.,7
"It's okay for me (from France), products and delivery.",7

"Great company to order from, after my order got lost in shipping somewhere, they reordered it for me and had it at door immediately",7
The t-shirt print yellowed after 1 day being in the sun and the entire part of the shirt that was printed on looked like a pit stain,7
"I love Tee Public, endless design and color choices, practically any design subject you can think of,they have! My shirts arrived quickly and they are exactly what I ordered, I love them. You can be sure I will be ordering again soon!",7
The t-shirt had a chemical smell. Some white paint from the inscription was smeared on the sleeve cuff. 8 inches of the hem came out after washing the shirt. I liked the color and the inscription.,7

"nice shirt, good quality, good shipping.",7
I have loved the services from here every time I order something. Even with longer shipping times they have been on top things. The shirts are always soft.,7
Very happy with my purchases. Print quality is fantastic. However two of the T-shirt���������s do have issues. One has a whole in the seam of the are and another has loose threading. Otherwise I���������m very pleased with the designs and amazed by the quality of the cushion! Would be keen to buy more but Royal Mail charges way too much to get parcels even tho I already paid postage. This purchase cost an extra ������13. However I was once charged �����,7

"Lots of design choices, in fact the most I could find online with Happy Camper and a tent.Fabric is a lightweight 100% cotton which only shrunk a little after washing and drying it.The women's cut is lovely and form-fitting, something hardly ever available.I needed to exchange for a larger size and they were more cooperative.",7

"The sizing for the ladies shirt was way too small.I ordered a large and it would fit a child.Not true to size.However, when I contacted TeePublic they immediately answered me with sending a new tee, different size, and no return required.Suggested I donate it.I would order from them again now that I know how their sizes run.",7
"The part of my shirt that was supposed to be brown taco meat is actually grayish purple, and I'm not impressed with the print quality. The black parts of the eyes and mouth are only black around the edges and splotchy grey in the centers. I was really excited for this shirt. Probably wont order again.*Edited to add: Customer Service is amazing! They will be replacing the shirt due to a problem with the print file. Thanks teepublic, I will definitely be ordering again!",7
Nice fit and look. They were excited to see it.,7
Excellent customer service and product quality,7
Shirts were very soft. I liked the photos on them. Size guide is a picture of someone wearing a shirt with no reference to actual inches. Both shirts were a size too small. They have a heavy odor from printing. I have contacted for an Exchange . I like to purchase and be done and not bother with returns. Please change your sizing from a picture of a person to an actual size chart with chest size and length.,7
T shirts arrived promptly and fit very well. Great experience overall. I will use them again.,7

"Just got in another batch of TeePublic shirts and I continue to love this company.The designs are great and unique.My kids love picking out different things and we all get compliments on the designs.We have ordered over 30 shirts in the past couple of years and so far, so good.I have had a few issues with sizing and printing but TeePublic replaces anything no questions asked.Make sure you turn the shirts inside out before washing.It does make a big difference and not doing so degrades the printing.It happened to a couple of our shirts but we got them replaced without hesitation.You won't find a better customer service from a t-shirt company.I wish we could get the shirts quicker as it takes about 10 days to get but I guess that is not too bad for custom shirts.The only criticism I would have is the website search and cart.I sometimes have a hard time finding designs in the search and then key in another word or phrase and find the design that doesn't necessarily correspond.Also, I would love to be able to add designs to my personal 'list' and have the website save those.We like to research different designs and then accumulate a few for an order.You can spend hours researching designs and it would be great to be able to save for a future purchase.Perhaps TeePublic can work on that.Big Fan.",7
Great product. The delivery took quite awhile.,7
"I love the creativity and the insight the artist put into their designs. Being a fan of many shows, movies, comic etc., I look for those images that speak to me. You can tell these artists are fans also and create from their heart and for the shows, comics, satire etc that they themselves love. I have never been disappointed with the Tee's I've ordered.",7
"Excellent Experience ordering.Quick delivery, products are quality.I will tell friends and continue to order",7
"Great t-shirts, arrived as ordered.",7

Printing was off center and I never received 1 of the 3 items I ordered.,7
I ordered an XL. When I got it it was marked XL but it was XS!. Normally I would get a ladies large. I held it up to a tee shirt that is a medium and this XL was 4 inches smaller than the medium. Please get your sizing correct. I will have to give this shirt to my 26 year old grand-daughter who weighs 96 pounds and then I'm not sure it will fit her.,7
Great shirts and printing was done very well.I found unique shirts that I could find no where else.,7

The t-shirt I purchased is the most comfortable t-shirt I've ever had. I was pleasantly surprised. It's surprisingly soft and durable.,7
I had to get a shirt a week before christmas and the person who made the shirt reached out to ask if i needed it by the holiday. Not only did the shirt show up before christmas but they did not charge me extra! This whole experience has been the best!!,7

Excellent choice for a gift. Good quality. Super service.,7
Not a fan of the way its printed. Shirt was a big smaller looking than an mens XL,7

"Great designs, comfy material, fast shipping, and wonderful communication. Oh and they are quick to remedy any errors.What more could you want?",7
I'd rate the service higher if the time before it gets shipped was shorter. I removed myself from the mailing list for this reason.,7

"Step Daughter loved the undertale long sleeve shirt. First words were ""it's so soft""",7
Customers service at its BEST!!!Designs are unique & awesome!!,7
"The material of the product was excellent however it does shrink in hot wash, so the fit after washing is snug. Also the collar tag on the Gildan t-shirt has sort of a glitter background and makes reading the tag difficult to almost illegible. In addition the screen print and the colors used for the fine lettering print around the circle does not contrast with surrounding colors and therefore the lettering is absorbed and thus the lettering becomes illegible. The above concerns are the reasons for my rating.",7
"The t shirt quality was better than I expected, and the artwork was perfect. It also arrived very quickly!",7
Awesome product! Good quality. Shipping was very fast for the season,7
Sweatshirt seems to be well made. Heavy enough to keep you warm. Good delivery time since was ordered near Christmas.,7
Got a t shirt for my daughters birthday good quality right fit.,7

Tapestry, Pillow, Mug, Sticker, Book - all of great quality.The Customer-Service is pretty friendly, answering fast and always offering help & uncomplicated solutions.Even the products have to be shipped half around the world, for me it's worth waiting for their arrival.",7

It���������s so so,7
"Great shirts,awesome graphics and delivered on time!",7
"Received 3 shirts, quick delivery great quality, although one shirt had a little bit of paint spread from screen print. Probably because print was not completely dry before sgirt was folded.",7
Fast shipping stickers are amazing but the printing on shirt could be better,7
Ordered two t shirts. Both look great and the sizes look correct. One is super soft which I think my cousin will like a lot. They arrived a couple of days early which was nice as I didn't have to last minute wrap. I would order again.,7
Very very happy.... it was a birthday gift for my fianc������ and it brought him to tears ��������������,7
"I ordered 3 tees from 3 different artists. I really like the very large selection of artists and designs. The printing is good. One of the best aspects of Tee Public is offering curvy size tees as I am a plus size woman. Al of my tees were scoop neck and the neckline is perfect! The quality of the tee shirts is very good, being soft and not too stiff. My only wish is that there were more color selections available in curvy tees as there was only the basics: black, red, white, grey and navy. As I was getting Christmas designs, green would have been a nice option. Price was very good and the tees arrived within a couple of weeks. This is the second time I have bought from Tee Public and I have been happy both times!",7
I love the shirt but it is a bit too small. I should have got a size larger but they did not have it in the color I wanted so I went smaller.,7

I ordered a sweater for my son but it was a bit too snug. Since my boy is husky sizes its always been a hassel to find the right size for him. I contacted teepublics customer service dept and described the situation and an angel by the name of Samuel authorized to send me a larger size with no need to send the one I bought back.Samuel went above and beyond my expectations. Tee Public saved this single dad a trip to the post office and made my boy very happy and comfy with his favorite character sweater. TeePublic fo life!!!,7

Then I left a bad review and got a canned public reply that attempts to make them look like they are offering to help. Look at their replies to poor reviews. Many are exactly identical. It looks preprogrammed and automated. Additionally, after I left my reviews, my entire account was deleted along with my wife's account too. It's like dealing with a five year old.

I bought these shirts for gifts and really liked all of the unique choices TeePublic offers! I would order from them again in the future.",7
Very disappointed in the last few purchases! Out of 10 t-shirts maybe 3 are decent! The shirts are cheap ( not of great quality) and just about every design is crooked! I love the idea of supporting independent artists but the shirts are usually too small even 2XL they will shrink the design comes off in the wash and all of them are crooked!one was do badthat I got a replacement and it looks good but now it doesn't fit even though I got the Same size 2XL. If you buy 5 shirts you might get one that you can actually wear. I loved this company the first few times I ordered t-shirts but this last round was just horrible. I don't think I'll be using them again.,7
Sweatshirt is super soft and nice. Design came out great! Love it!,7
Ordered and recieved 2 tshirts that I bought. Loved the color and designs but unfortunately the woman's size I ordered was too small. I reached out to customer service to exchange items for the same designs and colors but in a different style and size. An reply email was the next day.,7
The tshirt was perfect.Nice colors.The XL was true to size.,7
"Their prints are always perfect. And if it's not they replace the product immediately with zero hassle. That is why I continue to buy from TeePublic. They have the best designs on the market and much more options than any other T-shirt site. Plus, there's a ton of colors and both regular cotton tees and heather tees available. The image is always sharp (unless it's ""vintage"" and intended to be fuzzy) and they hold up to multiple washes and regular wearing. Put it this way; I'm disabled and live on a fixed income. I wear mainly comfort clothes. My humorous tshirts are a great ice breaker at the doctor's office. I've yet to have a visit to the doctors office (or dispensary, funny enough) without getting a compliment on my TeePublic T-shirt. That's fantastic because the nurses always remember Tshirt Guy if they don't know me by name. Your money is well spent at TeePublic.*I bought at least 5 Heather tshirts from TeePublic before I was willing to try their regular cotton tshirts because the heather is SO soft and doesn't shrink with multiple washes. Heather is a cotton/poly blend so the color stays sharp, too. I didn't try the regular cotton tshirts until it was the only option I had in the design available. I should have trusted them long ago! The standard cotton tshirts are SUPER soft and comfortable. I don't know if they will hold up as well as the heather but I'm willing to bet they will. So willing that I bought 2 other cotton tshirts. If I had one complaint about #TeePublic it would be that they only offer orange tshirts on standard cotton and not heather tshirts. But, more that I know how fantastic the cotton shirts are I will no longer hesitate to pick based on color instead of fabric choice.**Also, I'm 6' and 185lbs. I'm tall but not wide in the midsection. I often choose 2XL tshirts because of the length but, unfortunately, they tent out a lot in the torso and can look overly big even though the length is right. I do not have this problem on TeePublic. A 2XL fits fantastic, is very comfortable and has a little give on the off chance it shrinks a little over time.",7
Ilove my Vote.org tee shirt! I will be wearing it for a special voter registration event on August 21. It's perfect!,7
My friend designed me a logo and told me TeePublic was a great place to have it printed on many things. She also explained how she would get a small portion and I thought that was awesome. I bought 22 items for just over $500 and she said she got an alert that she would get $100 when TeePublic sent out payments. Then the next morning she got an e-mail that she had been banned for terms of service violation but didn't explain which. They also still haven't responded to her inquiry. October 15th is the payment day so she should have received her money already. The quality of the shirts is good but my friend got ripped off $100.Update: They finally replied again and reinstated her account. Took about a month. Still not ideal the way they handled it but I'll give them another star.,7
I've got about 10 or so Tees from them. All awesome quality. None of the prints have even begun to show signs of wear...which was unexpectedly welcome. Great store.,7
Absolutely excellent selection.Timely delivery.Good fit.Much more cool in real life than in an illustration on a smartphone. Keep up the good work.,7

"I have purchased from TeePublic several times in the past, but I have 2 issues that have me hesitating to buy from them anymore. First, I feel as though the printing quality has decreased over time. Perhaps this is an isolated incident from my last order, but I feel as though shirts make it through one wash and then the graphics start to erode away faster than the graphic tees I get from anywhere else. Second, DHL is an abysmal shipping provider. I know this isn't Amazon and I shouldn't expect packages to come in 2 days, but seriously, I paid $9.99 shipping for two shirts and waited over 2 weeks?

I am throughly impressed with the customer service from TeePublic! When my package became lost in transit I contact TeePublic. In less than 45 minutes I received a response and my shirts were reordered immediately. Adam was the customer service representative that really made me feel that TeePublic wanted to make me a happy customer. And they did. I would order more shirts from them anytime.,7
"Rarely do I have any issues with an order from TeePublic. Over the years I have purchased t-shirts, hoodies, art prints, and mugs; and all of them have been spectacular in quality and quick to ship.This holds true for an order I recently placed for the holiday season. The t-shirts and mug arrived quickly and as expected regarding quality of product.If I were to note any item of criticism is I wish there were some sort of opportunity to save a little bit on shipping when ordering items that are getting manufactured from difference facilities (like t-shirts and mugs, for example). You pay shipping individually for each location. I understand the general idea because well, TeePublic has to turn a profit but still even a minor discount would be appreciated.",7
"The first design wouldn���������t work, they reached out right away and we found the best alternative and they took care of my order. ���������This shirt is amazing! I would give it 100 stars,but I can only give it 5. Stupid Rules!��������� ~My Daughter��",7

The tee shirts are perfect. I chose the extra soft cotton tee. I did choose a size up and am very pleased. The print is exactly as it appears on the website. I will without doubt continue to get shorts from here.,7
I like the designs of the shirts - I would buy more if there were an option to order brushed cotton or extra soft material.I would pay more for this option.,7
There should be a rating for the individual artists. One of my T shirts the picture was worn as if I had it for years. If it was supposed to have the ���������distressed��������� look it should have been noted and picture should reflect it. Will,7

Everything was great! Only gave four out of five because the Navy blue I ordered looks much lighter in person when compared to the picture online.,7
"Great looking tee. Well made, nice quality print. I only gave it 4 stars because it was shipped out UPS but transferred to USPS and was 'lost' a few days. Probably not your fault, but it slowed down delivery and it's a gift.",7
Excellent product. Just as the picture showed. And it didn't take long to be delivered.,7

Easy shopping experience and product was top notch.,7
Love the T! shipping for one shirt was a little high,7
"Good quality t-shirt and quick delivery, wide range.",7
"Shipping made the 13 dollar shirt the same cost I would���������ve paid at a store: however I couldn���������t find ANY store that had the very specific shirt I was looking for. The shirts smell funny when they come out of the packaging. It was easy to order, came in the mail when I was told it would, and the size chart was very very helpful! Buying a top for tall slender man is usually a failure for me.",7
Everything came and looked just like it was supposed to.,7

"One of the laptop cases is awesome, however, the other has only a part of the picture printed, thus it looks somewhat stupid :D. I just had one thought about it ""You had one job"" (remember that meme), and one question - is it so hard to print?",7
"Love them! Excellent quality!! Just wish they came sooner, it took almost 2 months to get to us.",7
Was a bold design and a great price. Don't know about fit yet because it is a Christmas gift for my husband. I'm sure he'll love it!,7

Very good shipping.Screen print unfortunately peels easily,7
"Nicely printed shirt. Love the design. The shirt is nice and soft. It's a little on the thin side as far as material. It's also a little snug. I wear a 2XL and I probably should've ordered a 3XL for a better/truer fit. Still, I can't complain. Shipped fast. Looks and feels good.",7
Very cool company. Great array of designs. Fast and safe shipping.,7
"Great site with great products! Love my new shirts! Because of the independent artists, you can find unique items you can't find elsewhere!",7
I knew that it was going to take a while fine but my shirt was burnt !!! You could clearly see burn from the iron or whatever they put the picture on !! I will not order from them I would love for it to not have a burn stain It was so bad!!!!,7
"Ordered a couple shirts for my husband who loves unique shirts.Both were just what I wanted for him, can't wait 'til he opens them at Christmas.He will love them!",7

great Quality + fast delivery,7
"Great design, speedy service, and awesome price! Just wish the t-shirt was a little softer.",7
"The first order was lost, so it took nearly a month to get my $200 order and I'm not impressed. The screen printing on these are not the quality they used to be. The pictures are fuzzy and faded and horrible quality. The sweatshirts used to be soft and now they're using a scratchy type material. This company used to be amazing and being able to find unique sweatshirts was a huge plus, but I can't in good faith purchase from this company anymore- the lack of quality and customer service exceeds the awesomeness of the design.",7
"T shirts arrived in a timely Manner in cute packaging. Good quality, washed up well. Sizes run a little bit small.",7

You all delivered!! My hubby loved the hoodie with FOOL! written on the front :) he is a huge excalibur fan and I'm glad that the service was quick and simple.,7
I loved the shirt but during the buying experience I was frustrating because it double ordered a shirt. I kept changing it from 2 to 1 during checkout and didn't think to check it for a third time.,7
Very satisfied with my purchases & fast shipping!,7
I grabbed one of my wife's shirts to find her size... How misinformed I was on women's clothing sizes and how different styles change the sizes. Well because of that I ordered the wrong size and they honorably and painlessly helped replace my blunder with one that fit correctly,7
"Shirts arrived quickly, good quality and well packed in 1 box.",7
I love my shirt! In one day I got 5 compliments! I'll definitely be ordering more in the future.,7
I ordered an extra large......the label says extra large. It's actually somewhere between a small and a medium.,7
I love my shirt especially since it's so hard to find Jeffree Merch with him on it. The only problem for me was the way the picture printed really grainy.,7
Quality of the shirts are fantastic and shipping was on time. The cost to ship is a little pricey though.,7
Shirts are very good quality and sizing is pretty accurate. Maybe buy 1 size larger if you like a more comfortable fit.,7

"I'd have rated five stars to teepublic, if not for one thing. I sent them an email about a problem with one shirt weeks ago and haven't heard back. Considering, I've spent close to four hundred dollars in shirts with them, I expected better. The issue was that one shirt out of dozens was the wrong color. Something easily rectified, if they would respond.",7

The shirt is great! A quality product and unique. I ordered 2 more the other day.,7
Great product. Great artistic quality. Our family will be ordering much more.,7
The T-shirt I received is pretty good. Looks to be a decent quality. The true test will be after a few washes.I have given three stars because the amount of emails this company sends on a daily basis is ridiculous. Some days I have received up to 3 emails.,7

I let them know, and they immediately shipped out new shirts in a larger size at no charge - they even told me I could keep the ones I already had!The shirts are very cute, and I will definitely be ordering from this company again!",7

"Really enjoy the large selection of designs. If there���������s a thought I have for a design for a shirt, TeePublic usually has it. Only complaint is that I wish they would stick with ���������Gildan��������� shirts as they hold up better, particularly at the collar. The ���������Canvas��������� shirt are very poor grade.

Good took about as long as expected to get the shirts.,7
Shirt shrinks like crazy after first wash.Became thin and misshapen.,7
The Tshirt arrived with 2 massive holes in the shoulder. It's probably been on the shelf since the 90s because the material rips at the seams with light pressure and is pretty much see-through. Zero quality control.,7

Horrible the size chart is trash! I ordered a 2xl based on the pictures in the size chart. It was more like a youth large. I put it on my 8 year old son and the shirt was the next size up from what he would normally wear.I contacted them. And never received instructions to exchange my shirt. Just an generic email.,7
"Products are very nice, and the selection is absolutely unbeatable.HOWEVER, the sizing on the shirts is abominable.I have purchased three shirts over the past month, and all were absurdly small.I chose a size 5X for my brother and his son.They could hardly stretch the shirts over their heads and arms.I purchased a size XL for a young woman who wears a size 6.The shirt is too small.I could understand one shirt being improperly size, but not 3 out 3.",7

Awesome shirts.. fast shipping,7
"As a large person, I often have difficulty finding shirts in my size and preferred cuts. Not the case here! The sizing is excellent and the fabric is wicked soft and comfortable. I suspect it will shrink down a bit in the wash, but not enough that it will get too small. Definitely going to buy more from TeePublic. The only other thing worth mentioning is that shipping is done DHL/USPS style: starts at DHL and then gets handed to the postal service for delivery. Usually the tracking updates just sort of stop and then suddenly you get the delivered confirmation. I've found this to be the case with all DHL/USPS deliveries, regardless of retailer.",7
Great work on this Melly tee. Design is great. Fits perfect. Tight on the upper arms and chest while not being too snug on the lower torso. ������������������������,7
"Fast shipping, and easy to follow check out.",7
"I ordered a shirt way back around Christmas time and never received it. I brushed it off and didn't want to take the time to figure out what happened to it. Well, 7 months later, I decide to actually call TeePublic's customer service, and I was pleasantly surprised. The woman I spoke to on the phone was very friendly and the issue was resolved within minutes - the same shirt I previously ordered was placed in expedited shipping, free of charge. I wish I had called sooner!",7

"I bought a few different hoodies for Christmas gifts and the printed designs did not look like the pictures shown online. They looked blurry and not as appealing compared to clear crisp looking designs i thought I was purchasing. I figured I was gonna get something nicer for the price. Also the sizes of sweaters were off. I ordered two of the same size sweaters and the both fit different, which I have exchange now. I've never ordered from here before so let's see how easy that will go. Bottom line, the look online did not match what I got.Not sure if ill be ordering from here again.",7

The shipping is fast and packaging is good.,7

They went above and beyond in helping airh the exchanges I needed,7
"The design itself was pretty awesome, maybe a white, or light grey, coat down first, would really make the colors pop. I like the t-shirt, itself. It's a very soft material! My only complaint was the neck area, around the collar, was too wide, from left to right. Other than that, it's a pretty nice design!!",7
Product and artwork met expectations and delivery arrived before Xmas as promised.,7
The shirt was really cool except first washing and parts of the image tore so it���������s not looking as good. Sligh,7
"I order quite often, the biggest drawback is t-shirt quality. Some styles of the shirts are on Canvas t-shirts, other styles will be on a different fitting shirt. Like a Gilden shirt. One fits way better than the other. But it seems random, which will arrive on which type?It makes ordering a pain: if I get 5 shirts I may get three of them on the Canvas shirt and the others on the Gilden-type shirt. So some I���������ll be able to wear, others the fit is off. For the record I prefer Canvas. I just wish it was either standard across the board OR as a style option on the site. ���������Size, color, style of shi",7

My mum purchased a beautiful hoodie for my 8yr old daughter. Unfortunately she ordered the wrong size. I emailed TeePublic to exchange for a smaller size. Within a day they emailed me to say they had sent the correct size and we could keep the original hoodie too. What a wonderful customer service. Highly recommend. I will definitely use them again in the future.,7

The graphics were good. The adult size T-shirt was thin material.,7
"I work at a screen print company. I was pleasantly surprised that the shirt was a soft Bella shirt instead of just a cheap Gildan. The image was DTG so it was soft on the shirt instead of just a thick layer of ink. Because it was DTG, the image was not as sharp/clear as the mockup on the website. I was overall very happy though!",7

Love it and love the movie������������������,7
"The shirts I ordered were well priced and nice quality shirts. The graphics (black ink more than the color) are one are a little crisper than the other. But, still nice. Processing is slower than woot, but that's understandable since woot is owned by Amazon while this is a collection of independent shops selling shirts. I came to tee public because woot didn't have the designs for the two things I really wanted to buy. I had bought masks from them, so I knew they had nice products available. I'm very pleased with my purchases!",7

Cheers.",7
"I ordered four t-shirts, two of which were too small (I had gotten 2 large and 2 medium). After losing 40 pounds this year I wasn't sure what sizes to get so when I tried on the mediums and realized they were too small I reached out through their exchange option. To my surprise they not only agreed to ship me out the same two shirts in large - they didn't even require me to send back the brand new mediums and encouraged me to donate them or do whatever I saw fit with them. I will definitely be ordering from TeePublic again. Also, not only did the items ship quickly; the quality of the shirts for the prices are great! Customer support was also phenomenal with staff getting back to my exchange request within a day.",7
"Everything I ever bought from here was very nice and you can't beat the price, also super quick delivery.",7
"Purchased a vintage tshirt and absolutely love it. This is a great company and has the best online service department. If you have a problem, they take care of it fast and efficient. The only thing I suggest,is to buy items 1-2 sizes larger,depending on how you like it to fit.",7

"I was super excited to receive my tee public shirts in the mail. Great shipping. Arrived super fast.When I opened the package and even now hours later there is a very strong odor that will not go away. It's a paint or plastic smell, not quite sure. I ordered a curvy 3x, hoping for a baggy shirt and the shirt fits more like an xl (my normal size). Glad the shirt fit at all considering I paid extra for the curvy plus size fit, but definitely think i overpaid considering the shirt barely fit.",7

I have New Zoo Revue, vintage Sesame Street and Electric Company shirts, you can't find them anywhere except on this site. I always go here for my shirts! Great quality shirts and hoodies. Thanks sooo much to Tee Public.",7

"I love Teepublic they helped us so much picking out and finding shirts and more! They are very generous to let you keep a shirt if its too big and they will gladly give you another one. That���������s my experience so in my opinion they are the best!!!-This was written by my 13 yr old son! He had ordered shirts in men���������sinstead of youth sizes.I emailed the company and they responded that day saying that they would send the correct size.They also said there was no need to send the wrong sized shirt back, and that we could gift it to someone else!So we gave the men���������s size to his dad and now",7

The shirt I ordered's design was printed over a random piece of string that looks awkward and will that will eventually come off & strip out some of the shirts design print.,7

Quick delivery. Items exactly as described.,7
"Terrible so far. First time ordering from here. Ordered 2 of the same shirt. Received BOTH with various stains. One had a light black pen mark on the front. The other had a pea size black mark on front bottom left as well as a fingerprint sized ""coffee"" looking stain right in middle on front. 2 stains on one shirt and one stain on the other. Does anyone look at things before mailing them out to people? Or do we just not care? To boot, when I try to fill out the complaint form, the platform keeps rejecting the photos I try to send to show the stains. I'm trying to upload jpg files like they said and it just keeps saying upload failed, try again. Unbelievable. I'd look elsewhere & save yourself the trouble.",7
Great selection...i was really impressed.,7

"The printing on the sweatshirt was fine and it's nice to have this option for more design flexibility in college sweatshirts.However, the garments themselves, despite coming from Gildan (a recognizable brand), were of shoddy construction.The sleeve cuffs were twisted and lumpy, and when I inquired about it, customer service agreed that it was a defect and replaced the sweatshirt for free, but with yet another sweatshirt with the same defect.They replaced it with a third one and that did not have the defect, although the cuffs still are not great as the seam that attaches the cuff to the sleeve is misaligned.This could reflect poorly more on Gildan than on TeePublic, although TeePublic should insist on better quality control from its suppliers.TeePublic customer support was good about dealing with the issue, although I'm still surprised that with the detailed description of the defect in the original shirt (including photos), they did not notice that the first replacement had the same defect when sending it.",7

"I had the most amazing experience with this company. Not only was the shirt that I'd ordered very nice quality, but when I realized I'd ordered the wrong size, they were incredible. I had purchased it for my son's 7th birthday, and when it arrived, I realized I'd ordered too small. I contacted customer service and asked if I could exchange for a larger size, and if there was any way possible they could have it to me by his birthday, which at that point was only a few days away. They gave me the instructions for returning the one that was too small, and kindly let me know that they were happy to send the larger size, but it wouldn't be able to arrive in time. I thanked them, and decided to go ahead with the exchange. I said that it was the one gift I was looking most forward to giving my son, but that I'd just tell him about it on his birthday and give it to him when it arrived. Much to my surprise (and I won't lie, I cried) I received an email stating that they shipped the larger size - with overnight delivery at no extra charge! Not many companies would do something like that. If I could give more than 5 stars I would!",7

"I am very happy with the t-shirts I received. Nice quality. Also, very pleased with how good they were with tracking my merchandise. Would definitely buy again. Wanted to buy a mask but did not want to pay the high shipping for only that item.",7
I like the quality of the material but..... the extra large that I ordered thinking it would give me a little room fit wise...is very tight. As someone said it's sized more for the Asian clientele.Not the standard Americansize chart.,7
I love the t-shirt design I ordered but the size was not the correct size this shirt I got is like a large not a 2x large plz let me know if I can exchange this,7

Shipping was very fast and I loved my shirt!! I will definitely be ordering again!,7
I love all the tshirts that I buy from Tee public and the individual creators. I get so many compliments everywhere I go when I wear certain t shirts that no one has seen before. The quality is excellent and they hold up really well after multiple washes. The only thing I wish is that I could see a list of my past orders and who made the shirts so that I can order and support those creators again and see if they have any new designs.,7
"Wonderful company! I had an issue with my order (nothing that would keep me from purchasing again). They replied promptly and asked for some info. They didn���������t even wait for a reply and made it right! Stellar customer service, which is unheard of these days. Will absolutely bu",7

"All the Tee shirts were better than expected, great job!",7
Fast delivery. Great quality of shirt and great design!,7
So initially I was hesitant but I decided to take a chance. The designs are awesome. Even though I had an issue with the delivery (not uncommon for the city I live in) the customer service took care of the issue. They issued a new order and I received it within a week. I got so many compliments from my shirts that my coworkers wanted the website.,7
Nice t-shirts. I hope my wife likes hers but worried that it may be a little bit on the small side. But I love both of mine!,7
"Update: 2018-12-21My original review is below for context. I���������m updating my review to reflect my very good experience dealing with TeePublic���������s customer service. I was somewhat snappish (I���������m ashamed to admit) in my email thread with the support representative, and despite this they were always kind, patient, and professional as they resolved my issue by shipping out a larger sized shirt to replace the original. For this reason, my opinion has completely changed and I now give them 5 stars since such good customer service is too rare these days and I value it highly.My original issue arose due to the fact that their ���������premium��������� t-shirts have a different sizing scale, something to be aware of when ordering. If you pull up their sizing chart after first selecting the ���������premium��������� option it may not be obvious that it defaults to displaying tch size is smaller than their equivalent for regular shirts (but they go up to 5XL).Hopefully they���������ll make their web UI regarding this a little more clear but despite the confusion, given their A+ customer service, I���������ll buy from them again.Original Review: The order process was fine. Shipping was slow and overpriced. My 3XL shirt as delivered is smaller than most of my other 2XL shirts. I've never had such a huge size disparity.By contrast, I ordered a different t-shirt from another site immediately _after_ I'd ordered this one from TeePublic. The shipping cost was lower. The t-shirt cost was lower. This site and TeePublic officially shipped using DHL where the final leg of the journey is via the US postal service.However, my other (non-TeePublic) shirt arrived a week earlier and is a true 3XL shirt (like literally _every_ other t-shirt I've bought). Also, whil""premium"" and was $25, this other shirt was $20, not billed as premium, and is, if anything, higher quality fabric.Not impressed with TeePublic. I'll have to return this supposed 3XL shirt since it's too small.",7
"Takes a bit longer than I would think to ship and get here (order of 5 shirts took 2 weeks).Had an issue with a shirt's printing being messed up but a new one was sent immediately.I'd say 3.5, but will round up due to that.",7
T-shirt is awesome. My brother is going to hate me for it! I love it!,7

I absolutely LOVE the shirt that was designed! TeePublic always offers unique options. The communication from the time I ordered to the time it was delivered was also great!TeePublic is definitely a site I would recommend to anyone looking fora great quality t-shirt with an awesome design.,7
The shirt logo was off center. I will never spend my money with this company again. It took so long to get the shirt. I rather just lose out on the money instead of returning it. Terrible quality.,7
Easy to use. Lots of choices. Perfect for a spur of the moment gift.,7
The shirts look great and appear to be high quality. The customer service was top notch,7
I love my shirt but some people pointed out that there is some over spray or something on the front and back.Several people commented positively on the shirt. I do not want to return it as I will live with it as I really like the design.,7

Fast and easy. Also i love the overall product especially the material.,7
Absolutely the best and faster Customer Service I've ever experienced!! Amazing Company!,7
"These shirts are absolutely adorable and all of my boys love them.Husband, Son and Grandson.",7
Very satisfied with every single item i received. It's true to size and the material of the fabric is of good quality. It did have a certain smell to it that i can't really say what it was. Might have been the ink of the design. Put it to wash on delicate and air dried and the smell is gone now. Definitely a repeat customer.,7

The bottom half of the print cannot be seen and it is silver on a light grey hoodie. The letters on the top have black tones in the lettering and is easily seen.,7
Nice cup friend really liked art. Slow shipping.,7

Graphics look great but sizing is way off. If you need a 3x then order the 5x!!! Quality is great just sizing is OFF!!!,7
"The picture we saw online was a pristine clear picture on the shirt, the shirt we received was faded looking, looked like a vintage, worn design instead of sharp, clear design.When I contacted them, they addressed the issue and sent a new shirt.Great company.",7
Packages showed up a week late and I paid extra for expedited shipping. No phone number to reach a human being. Awful customer service.,7
"They did a really good job on the design, looks just like the Mr.Beast merchandise and the material is really good as well. Customer service was great! Even though I messed up my order they were willing to help and got back to me quickly, everything was just great! Defentely will order more stuff from here! ����",7
"Great quality shirt, easy to order, and quickly shipped. Loved the design!",7

"Nice website, easy to use. Reasonable mid quality product. They share good percentage to the creator Would use again.",7
Product was fine and was made and delivered as promised.I thought it was expensive and with the added shipping made my t-shirt cost too much.One solution would be free shipping.,7

I initially received one item in the wrong size and two items with the wrong design. I contacted TeePublic and they replaced all 3 items without question and in a very timely manner. They let me keep the items sent in error and I was able to pass them on to the opp. shop. �����������,7

"Had to return an item (T-shirt, size issue). Another was sent at no cost and I was able to keep the original. Really helpful.",7
my order came in a timely manner and price in good for the quality of shirt. You need to go in more detail about the type of shirt people are ordering (example: premium shirt) I am new to your site so I really didn't know what to do. Also you need to use better color schemes on some of your designs or better yet let the customer pick the color scheme.,7
"Both shirts are too small and I ordered the size I always wear.Also, one if the shirts was not what I ordered and I have no idea how to return the shirts for replacements.",7

Great job on the shirts I ordered! Very pleased.,7
"I ordered a shirt with a print of Anthony Bourdain on it, super excited about it. With covid I understand the shipping taking a long time, but when I finally got the shirt, the print was awful. Maybe it was blown up too large so the quality was poor? But the picture is blurry.",7
"The design on my products were very half ass printed on. Quality was not up to par. The designs are easily scratched off. Expedited shipping doesn���������t mean a thing apparently, because it arrived 2 days late and only shipped after making",7
Shirts arrived on time and are good quality and size and are comfortable.,7

I give 3 stars, as I originally had a family member order me one of the shirts as a Christmas gift, which was never received. She had to dispute it with her credit card company, as the company did not get back with her in a timely manner. I also stated that since we waited almost a month and a half could they provide me with free shipping or a discount for giving them a second chance, to which they did not due to this matter.",7
Nice shirt and quick shipping but all 3 shirts didn't seem to fit right on my left shoulder. Didn't lay flat on the seem. Not completely satisfied for a $30 t-shirt but didn't want to return.,7

"The first order had defective sweatshirts. I requested a refund, willing to return the items but was sent the exact same sweatshirts. I wasn't given the option to change anything about the order. I would've wanted my money back first and foremost, if not I would have liked to make the decision as to what to replace the items with. ( Same price expectations) I researched the prices of the given sweatshirts, 'Gildan' brand which I noted pricing to be under $20. The designs were well done but I wouldn't have paid that much for the designs placed. Overall I feel like the prices were well over what they should've been. Since the experience, I've bought my products directly with the NBA, NFL labeled items. I would buy more products from TeePublic if I had a better experience and possibly less expensive, pending the options. Customer service did respond very timely and was kind.",7

The mask was sewn well but it did not have the design that is more ergonomic: with a metal flexible nose bridge and fitted under the chin; rather it is straight across and does not hug the face.,7
"I initially ordered a t-shirt and keenly anticipated its arrival. When it arrived, I opened the package, pulled out the shirt and, to my chagrin, saw that the graphic design was barely discernible. The shirt itself was of high quality, but I have many high quality t-shirts and I wanted this one specifically for the design. I read the ���������no-return��������� policy and gave the shirt to my wife. She convinced me to order another. I did and the graphics were marginally more visible. As a point of reference, the first shirt w",7

I never received my order. But it says delivered.,7
"Everything arrived quickly and all the shirts I ordered came out pretty perfect!! They were Christmas gifts and the people who received were very pleased. Only complaint from me is shipping costs. Due to that being so high I could only order 3 shirts as opposed to the 10+ and coffee mug I originally had in my cart. Still tho, I'm very pleased overall and can see myself ordering from here again",7
I just love the tshirts. Will be ordering again. Fast shipping as well,7
The ease of ordering on line the delivery was in great,7
Nice design but applied 1 inch off the center of the shirt.,7
"DHL lost my order, and teepublic was quick to respond with an apology when I brought it to their attention. A replacement shirt was shipped out and received within ten days of my bringing the issue to their attention.",7

TeePublic is great. One of the best customer experiences I have ever had. Purchased two shirts and needed to exchange due to wrong size. They placed the reorder sent a confirmation and told us to not bother returning shirts that did not fit be to give them to someone or donate (which we did) That������,7
The print quality was very nice! Shirt size fit just right. Tracking number attached to it made it easy to keep watch on it during the holiday season.,7
Awesome company! I ordered the wrong size they were quick and awesome with help. Was able get my new order here within the week. Super impressed. It was a birthday present and came the day before PERFECT timing. So satifisied with all their help and the company. Product is good quality.,7
Excellent company to work with.good quality products as well,7
Great quality shirts and wonderful print. Everyone asked us where we got them. Good fit,7
My T-shirt had a cool design but the quality of the shirt itself was bad. The neck was all stretched out and it had the crappy seams running down the side of the shirt.,7
High quality soft tees for a fair price. Love mine.,7
I have always had really good luck with this website. A million different designs to choose from and lots of different styles which is a welcome change from the typical unisex T-shirt fit!,7
I love my shirt! Fits a little small for a men's medium. I would have sized up.,7

Great products. Beautiful designs.,7
Great shirts. Size M in women tee seemed a bit bigger than my regular size M. I would order a size down for better fit. Design is great. Shipping is slow which is expected because of the pandemic.,7
"The shirt and sticker I ordered were of very high quality. A bonus, the graphic on the T-shirt was appropriate scale for the size of the shirt. I would recommend and purchase from again!",7
Have purchased a number of items from republic - great company to work with!,7
"I received my tee shirts as requested in just a few days. They are perfect as always; this is my third purchase. The artwork is great as is the reproduction. The tee shirts, themselves, are excellent as well.",7
The masks I ordered are extremely small. Just basic masks but dinky. Can't wear them. I won't be ordering from teepublic anymore.,7
Shirts look amazing & so affordable. We wanted matching t-shirts for the holiday on my unit & are so pleased with the selection we made,7

The website was easy to use. I was able to find what I needed for Christmas presents and they were delivered in a timely manner. Great job!,7
"The sticker and shirt delivery time was great, however I just noticed that both of them have ""Always be youself"" not ""Always be yourself"". So, I don't believe it is spelled correctly and I only noticed that when I received them. Then, I looked back at the website and they're the same way so I'm unsure if some misspelling happened or not. Also, both the ""can be a"" on the sticker and shirt are faded so much you can't properly read what it is saying which is unfortunate.",7
Great products. Great customer service. Had an issue with a size and the immediately rectified it and sent a new one out next day. Great service!,7
Great customer service and fun selection of items!,7
Nice Tees. Only thing I have a complaint about is shipping prices and the time it takes to receive. Even if you pay extra the fastest delivery is 5-6 days. Fix that and 5 stars is yours.,7
I bought a shirt and it turned out to be too small and they replaced it free of charge and didn���������t even make me return the small one. It will look great on ,7
I bought the shirt for my son in-law for Father's day. He loved it.,7

"I purchased a shirt in a Large (a size bigger) for a family member who is 5'2 and 150lbs. When the shirt arrived, it fit like a child's Medium and customer service was helpful in sending me out another size bigger (XL). When the XL arrived, there was nothing different between the Large and XL except that the XL was an inch longer in length. When both shirts laid over each other, the width of both shirts were identical and still snug on the recipient as if it were meant for a much smaller child frame; not adult frame. My experience in finding a shirt and working with customer service to send out a replacement shirt (XL) was good. But at this point, I was not going to reach out again to fix sizing.",7
Fits amazing and extremely comfortable asf!!! I recommend washing the shirts with cold water setting and lightly dry them....they came slightly shrink after first wash.,7

They work quickly and before you know it the product you ordered is at your door.Their work is very good and I have never had a problem with an order. I recently ordered a bunch of tee shirts and all were done correctly and I was happy with all the products.Tee Public is my go to company when I want a specific tee shirt.I'm sure you will be happy with their products and results.,7
Quick delivery and excellent customer care.,7
"until request is filled to replace items that were printed on lesser quality they'll get a low rating. not first time this has happened with my order. neck rib is of poor quality and stretches out, making tees useless, unless you like a quitter neck then you'd be okay.",7
Best shirts! Awesome designs!,7
very fast delivery with clean print on quality shirt,7
I purchased a hooded sweatshirt with Tweetie bird on it especially for my Autistic grandsons 6th birthday. Finding a pattern suitable for a child was not an easy task since Looney Tune characters are not the rage right now. This website offered so many choices it was fantastic!!!I found exactly what I knew would thrill him. The quality is superior.The colors are bright and vibrant. It is a thick and warm sweatshirt and the sizing is correct. What more could I ask for? When he opened the package he squealed with joy.Case closed. Perfect purchase as far as I'm concerned!!!!!,7
Great T. but I think the printed image was too large on the shirt.,7
Daughter loved the design!,7
"Great hoodie, great design! A little logo or design on the front could be cool though if I were to give a single little critique.",7

Reagan killed all the birds,7
Nice quality t-shirts cool graphic designs I would recommend these to my friends,7
"It took much longer than expected to receive our order, part of the problem was the shipping method was very odd, shifting from ups to usps in the middle of shipment. As I tracked the shipment it came to our town, less than 10 miles away, and then got sent two states away, to then take another 3 days to get to us. Very weird. When I contacted TeePublic by email about the shipment it took almost a week to hear back from anyone, and when I did hear back they were not helpful.",7
My entire order was wrong and the quality of the shirts weren't very good.I was not pleased at all.,7

Great product and got here quick. Very happy with this vender.,7
"I really love the creativity of the site. I like how nice and sleek the look of it is and the convenience of an app. I am not too keen on the pricing though, everything is a bit high priced and not fair to the buyer or seller percentage wise. All around I really like this store and will definitely buy from you guys again. Once I get paid of course.",7
I loved the design but the hoodie was too small I ordered a large and it came in as a med and I didn���������t get the sticker,7
I bought an Over the garden wall sweatshirt for my son. He loves it! The artwork is wonderful and the sweatshirt came very quickly! The only issue is that the chest area of the sweatshirt is tight so that needs to be kept in mind when purchasing.,7
"Ordered 4 Christmas presents through the site. They said ���������shipped��������� a week later (!). No tracking for 4 days. I tried 3 times to contact customer service and didn���������t get any response (emails and social) for 3 days. By then I had tracking that the order hadn���������t moved in 4 days and was going to be far past when we needed it. Customer service said ���������sorry not sorry that���������s how it is��������� - they apparently use the slowest, cheapest shipping option to skim the money from orders (having worked for an e-commerce company I���������ve seen this before). Now the order is delayed with the shipper even more after going T",7

Very good qualitytee shirt. Very pleased,7

"I was hesitant ordering from Facebook ads, but I kept seeing this one hoodie that I really loved the design. It arrived on time, fits well, and is extremely comfortable.",7
"I absolutely love the hoodie I just got from them, it fits perfectly and it's soft and really hits on all fronts. the only reason I didn't give 5 is because it had an odd odor upon arriving (which is fine, clothes usually do due to the packaging they arrive in) but upon washing the white text on my hoodie turned slightly pink (which is again to be expected but still)Overall, very happy with my purchase",7
I order I tshirt for Christmas gift and it arrived it was totally the wrong one not even close..,7
"Woman's shirts are run way too small, fine. My prints turned out very well. I contact customer service & was told to send back shirts. I pay shipping, fine. I didn't have time to send them back until after the holiday (I'm talking like 5 days. One was a Sunday, no mail) I finally made it to post office. Only to receive another email telling me I do not need to send back the shirts. I had just sent them out, about 2 hours prior. I didn't even email them with the the tracking yet. I question this and they ignore it and ask me what new sizes I need. I tell them and question again, with the 3rd new person, why I was told 2 different return policies. Finally another person, and was told this isn't the return policy anymore. So, do not pay to have your defective items sent back. Just wait, they will tell you it's no big deal... apparently. They have sent me out a new order with changed sizes. I'm waiting to see if they are going to credit me my money for sending back stuff I didn't need to. Or send me back my wrong sized items because I can always give them to someone else for a birthday or something. Other then this stupid run around. Everything came out fine. So far. But I won't order again. Will update after new items received.",7
I love this site!My boyfriend loved his gift the pillows are dope Will be buying again,7
Funny design I���������ve never seen ,7
"Pretty Designs, quick Deliverie, great Quality",7
This company is great! I had ordered a t-shirt and I received it in a timely fashion but it was too small. I requested an exchange and they quickly responded to me and sent out a replacement in the next couple of days. I would totally recommend this company to my friends and will most definitely be purchasing from them again in the future!,7
"Delivered safe and sound.the Welsh mug and pin were perfect. Brilliant colors in the mug. The pin is shaped like the country, Wales. I has much detailing in the daffodils, leeks and red dragon. Great on hat or lapel.",7
The mask I ordered was poor quality. The lettering was smudged and unreadable. It was rough to the touch and the stitching was loose.,7
Both shirts were nice but on one of them you can't really even see the word papa on the gray colored shirt so I'm going to try To get a hold of the company to make an exchange.,7
I ordered 3 shirts & all 3 fit great & the print was also great,7

"Wayne���������s World shirts are hard to come by, I loved the ���������schwing��������� it���",7
Awesome. Got exactly what I wanted.,7
"Ordering and delivery were good, but mostly I absolutely love thisT-shirt. A heartbreaking thing is when trans youth are rejected by their families and especially when they're kicked out of their homes. Their despair is palpable, and the increased risk of suicide is tragic. It makes me so sad and angry and fearful - especially now, when much of the country is trying to legislate against their humanity, acceptance, and rights. I gave one of my stimulus checks to a rejected homeless trans young woman, and said I wanted to pass on a mother's acceptance and love. This shirt gives the same message to so many people! I really love that it includes trans as well as LGB.Thank you for suggesting ordering a larger size. I'm petite-to-average and the Large fits perfectly. Also, the shirt is the most comfortable one I own. - Jennifer",7
Customer service was willing to send me a new size when the original didn't fit.,7
"Good shirts, good prices. Eh shipping though. With every proceeding order, seems to take longer to get to me. First order arrived 10 days from date of order, second order was 9 days. Current originally scheduled to arrive May 2 (10 days), delayed to May 4 (12 days), according to shipping time from when DHL receives to when USPS puts in my mailbox 4 days so I'm expecting this package maybe Monday or Tuesday, Saturday if I'm lucky. Edit: It's May 4. DHL still says expected date of arrival: May 4. Supposed to have tendered package to USPS at 3:26 a.m. USPS shows no signs of receiving said package, therefore I have no clue when I will receive package. Order was made April 22. Supposed to be shipped out on April 26. DHL received package on May 1, sent out package on same day. I don't know who to be more frustrated with, TeePublic, DHL, or the USPS (I already absolutely loathe the latter two). Was a 4 star rating due to bearable, but somewhat long, delivery times. Dropped to 3 because 7-10 business days no longer applies at this point, unless they can somehow get it to me by midnight.Edit 2: Worked with Michelle in customer service regarding my order and its lateness. She helped reach a satisfying conclusion. Shirts finally arrived after so long.",7
I love the design! It combines 2 things that i shamefully engorge myself in waayy too often,7
Great quality shirt with funny designs at a good price! Perfect!,7

Communication throughout the ordering process was great. The design I wanted was spot on. I just wish the T-shirt was a better quality and softer. It is true that you have to size up for the females; I suggest going up 2 sizes.,7

"Ordered 2 heavyweight cotton t shirts, arrived today, quality was great, but unfortunately larger than expected (maybe order down in size? Or I may have just misjudged).I completed an exchange request, and literally within minutes was notified of a replacement order in the amended size, followed by an email from customer service, saying I didn't need to return the originals (I'll donate them to a charity shop).Excellent customer service, will definitely buy from them again once I know the replacement size fits.",7

The customer service rep told me that I could keep the old shirt and the new one was free of charge which surprised me, I expected to send the old one back in.

Order arrived quickly. Much quicker than I expected.,7
The shirt has a great design but feels 2 sizes smaller.I ordered Large and it would be too tight to even fit as an under shirt.I usually wear medium or large tee shirts.No return or exchange policy is unfortunate too.,7
Affordable quality tshirts and fast delivery!,7
"I ordered two shirts. Once I accidentally ordered the wrote size. Both shirts looked amazing. I asked if I could exchange, it was in fact my mistake, and immediately sent me out a new shirt.

"Service was great and turn around time was excellent. I only wish the brand of shirt used was better. Gildan shirts are very short. They never fit properly. They are also very thin and get turn or worn out very easily. They also shrink a lot in the dryer. A brand such as Goodthreads makes a much better fitting and durable shirt which would leave your customers with a better product. I want to order several of the shirts that I see on your site, but I'm nervous now that I received Gildan shirts. I am placing a second order with a ""premium"" shirt option. Hopefully it's a better brand. Again, your team and workmanship seem great. It's just a shirt brand issue.",7

"I am happy with 11 out of 12 shirts. There was one shirt I didn't think was done very well. I think there should be some kind of discount for purchases over ""X"" number of shirts or ""X"" number of dollars. Their prices are a little high but still competitive. Shipping was covered (I think). The product quality seems to be pretty good, and the lead time was pretty good too. I would probably buy from them again",7

"Every single article of clothing on this website has a giant image or logo on it, yet when you buy the product, the image or logo is FAR smaller than what is advertised, with the excuse of a silkscreen peeling if it's put over a seam (for example over the pocket of a hoodie)Adjust what your website is showing people and you wont be lying to people. Your services are trash if your online images don't match what you're actually printing.It's VERY clear that your pictures used in advertising are ""paper doll"" style slides where a program has simply paper dolled a logo onto a stock sweatshirt or shirt.But the images you're showing are so much bigger than what you're printing it's ridiculous.",7

Your artists are awesome, and the color choices are excellent.I would like to see more color choices on my premium shirt though.Your shipping is also rather slow.I understand that certain things take time, but for $11 in shipping with a 6-8 business day delivery promise... and then receiving my stuff a few days after that...I don't know man.Other than that, the quality and longevity of my t-shirts has been outstanding.Thank you!",7
"My ""experience"" comment, which I give only to provide feedback, arises only because the slightly excessive delivery period for an order I only vaguely remembered caused me to spend hours t (a) find the charge on my bank statement, (b) determine what it related to and (c) track down the original promised delivery info, all AFTER the promised maximum 8-day delivery period.The product's arrival a couple days beyond the max was consequential only because of the time needed to track down all the purchase details to determine whether follow-up action was needed.",7

Bad print job at the bottom of the mask. Looks like Sorcomo Oworeness instead of Sarcoma Awareness and I can barely see the last 2 S���������s. Also there���������s a color bleed in the text. I bought this as a gift for a friend who lost her son to Sarcoma in 2020 but didn���������t give it to her due to the poor quality. I gave 2 star,7
The shirts are amazing! Sizes are great and fit wonderfully!,7
"The work by the artist, Jen Robison is fun and inspiring.",7
Loved the product.The shippingnot to fond of.,7
Received first item ordered in a timely manner.,7
I'm a 2x and the shirt is easily a medium size despite the tag,7
"I have still not received my order.According the your tracker it was ""received"" on Friday, June 19 but there is no package still, one week later. And it is virtually impossible to get in touch with you. Your service is AWFUL!!!!!",7
The shirts from our first order did not fit so we contacted customer service about exchanging them for a different size. They not only replaced the shirts and shipped them to us at no charge but they told us to keep the original shirts as well. Very pleased with our new shirts!,7
The shirt I ordered was supposed to be Navy Blue and was Black. I would click on Navy to add it to my cart and it would show up as black in the cart.The sizing was also a bit small.,7
"My experience was great! I will keep using TeePublic for all my T-Shirt needs (and stickers too!). I was so happy to see that the designs can be on stickers, mugs, masks, hoodies, etc. I can't wait to upload my own designs and give them a shot. Will be back and returning for sure! Thanks TeePublic for making it happen :)",7
"I love Tee Public! I���������ve ordered from them multiple times and haven���������t been disappointed. I ordered some shirts for Christmas on Black Friday, and the tracking never got sent to me - I emailed customer service to ask if they could check on the tracking for me, and they sent me the 2 shirts again at no extra charge. I love the designs, the softness of the shirts,",7
"The product is good, the rating is because of the very late shipping and as the first item was lost in the holiday shuffle, a second was shipped. Now, the CS reps were friendly and did refund my expedited shipping fee so the overall experience rates 3 stars. But I would try them again but would leave more runway for delivery.",7
"Ordered for the first time from this site but will do so again. Products came in, quickly and efficiently, and of high quality. Had a sizing issue with one item and they replaced it , no problem, for no additional freight cost. Highly recommend.",7
I have recommended TeePublic to several people.Love everything I've purchased.,7
"The amount of options to choose from was AMAZING!! Not only that, but I'm an old school/80's girl & I found EVERYTHING (and then some) that I was looking for! Then to top it off, to be able to get things from a sticker to a mug to a t-shirt....forget it, I'm a fan for life! LOVE this site/store!! Glad I happened upon it!",7
"LOVE LOVE LOVE, will order again!",7
"This company is topnotch in its commitment to customer satisfaction. I ordered 3 women's T-shirts in small. I usually wear small or extra small. When they arrived, they fit too snug and definitely wouldn't fit after washing. I contacted TeePublic, requesting mediums instead. Within a week or two, I had three new T-shirts in a size that fits. I did not have to return the small ones. Instead they said I should donate them or gift to someone else. This kind of customer service is incredible and so rare these days. I'll definitely order from them again.",7
"Ordering the shirt and quality were fine. Shipping was not fine. It took over two weeks to be delivered. Also you really need to work free shipping into your business model. $6.99 shipping for a t-shirt? Shrink your margin if you have to, but otherwise Amazon will continue to eat your lunch.",7
"Coltrane shirts arrived as promised! graphics look great, even against grey! Nice job, I'll be getting more! cheers,Rio",7
"Tees were decent quality, reasonably priced,and arrived quickly. Only problem was that the website showed the picture on the back of the tees, and when they came, they all had the photo on the front.",7
"Great artists, and quality tees.",7
"The shirt was delivered perfectly! I just wish there was washing directions included with the order so I don���������t mess up the design on a first wash. However thanks to a quick google search I was able to find em, definitely ",7
Excellent design on my shirt. Perfect sizing. Good quality and was shipped quickly!,7

Order was placed and received quickly and easily.,7
"Love these pins from Blue Avocado, only available on TeePublic! Have passed on the site name to several people for perusal.",7
"Good service, however the palm tree is nice and green on one shirt Gray one and yellow on the White one. Does not look like the same shirt.",7
Inferior material quality !after one wash shirt turns into a rag looses shape and looses length,7
"Out of the 16 shirts I ordered 15 were excellent!! One that arrived was very ""fuzzy"", it was almost as if they had used a VERY low resolution photo for the shirt. But of the multitude of shirts I've ordered over the years this has been the first and only one that hasn't arrived sharp and pristine. Would still recommend them to everyone!!",7
Easy to order! Excellent customer service with a quick response. Very pleased with my purchase and will definitely order again!,7
"Great Service, fast shipping! Wonderful product. Couldn���������t be more ple",7
Love my shirt! Looks just as described!,7
"While it's a bit early to rate the longevity of these shirts (I've had some from other companies have the artwork peel over time), I can say that TeePublic is probably the best one I've purchased from so far.Great artistic selections, variety of shirt colors, types and materials and their customer support is superb.",7
"Fast shipping, product arrived in good condiiton.",7
"You Made My Moms Day! I am taking my mother of 70yrs to her 1st ever concert and you are the only online service that sells ""The Zombies"" t-shirts in her size. You have made a dream of hers a reality. The shirt is great and fits so comfortably. I cannot thank you enough for bringing joy to my mom.",7
Ear loops were a little loose (not the designers fault). The orientation of the words on the mask are a little awkward. Remove the graphic at the top and devote the space to a better arrangement of the lyric. Lots of compliments on it overall.,7
"The print on one of the 4 t-shirts I have ordered didn't come out very well, is bent, still nice though... Anything else very good!",7
"My husbands shirt that I bought for his birthday was too tight, I could not find my original order number and they were able to find it and process my exchange so quickly. Would order again for sure",7
"Great shirts, timely delivery. And the stickers are great too! Made my husband's Christmas ��������",7
"I ordered 2 t shirts the graphics are very good,quality of the fabric is very good, customer service is very good, they came earlier than quoted my only complaint is the women's sizing is too tight.I will order again and get larger sizes.Overall I am pleased to find my t shirt source.",7

I live the shirt I order. But tho I need extra large and large. The size seem smaller then I thought.I may order again. The quality of the print on the shirt was fantastic.,7
Over priced to begin with the international postage made it ever more expensive,7
TeePublic is my favorite site ever right now. I have ordered several shirts from them. All have been excellent quality with fast shipping. I get so many compliments on my shirts. Highly recommend TeePublic and happily tell everyone about them.,7
Great product. Clear graphic and soft material. Material as soft as advertised.,7
I had an incredible experience from start to finish with Teepublic! The designs were so cool and creative! I have had a hard time in the past finding pop culture designs that I have loved.........however not the case with Teepublic! I had a hard time picking a few T-shirt���������s because I could have picked dozens! K will definitely be purchasing many more T-shirt���������s from Teepublic! Keep ,7
"The parcel came later than I expected, it was a BD present for my son, but came late. The quality is okey for the price I paid for the T-shirt.",7
Shirts are soft and well made with clear graphics. Sizes fit all 5 kids great!,7
"Initially I would have given a 5 star rating because they were so cool about replacing the 1st order. I even offered to mail it back at my own expense, but they said no. So I ordered my replacement but the item I got was not what I thought I was getting and now no one is responding to me. It should have been titled specifying that the print looks cracked and old on purpose. So maybe ""vintage font"" or ""cracked print"" or something along those lines. Also, it should have a more clear picture showing the print up close. If you look at the pictures for the item I ordered you would have to zoom in really close or already know it was there to notice the condition of the print. There's a 2nd pic that shows the print a little closer but because the watermark looking symbols all over it you wouldn't notice the print being any different from a regular printed shirt. Now I have a brand new shirt that looks like I've been drying it on high for many years. Not what I wanted.",7
Great images and art from independent artists. Great shipping - gets here when promised!,7
"Good quality product, delivery on time",7
"For the price I paid for a child���������s sweatshirt, the quality was unimpressive. A simple iron on decal, (albeit a difficult decal to find), was placed off center and had a rather faded appearance. My grandson will still love it though. The company, however, was easy to work with. Orderand shipping went smoothly. My issue is with the quali",7

"Excellent customer service! I was sent the wrong color Tshirt (but the shipping was very quick). I filled out the customer service form. Within a day, a customer service representative emailed me, just asking for a photo of the shirt and the inside tag, so their team could prevent this in the future. I accidentally saved the email as a draft when I thought I sent it. But after not hearing from me after a few days, another agent reached out to follow up and see if I still needed help. I sent the email and right away they responded and said they'd be sending the replacement and that I could also keep the shirt that was sent in the wrong color. Excellent experience through and through. Very soft, good quality shirts.",7
EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE BUT I THINK THE SHIRTS ARE VERY THIN AND WON'T LAST LONG FOR THE PRICE...,7

I have never written a negative comment about a company but I hope this will help them. I ordered 2 JETS (Just Endure The Suffering) lol ; 1 was a female small which is more like a childs medium and I ordered a mans 2XL which is like a 4XL. The sizing needs to be adjusted,7

"The shirt came way faster than I expected! It looks great but the printing seems like it'll start to wear after a couple washes, fingers crossed it won't though. Definitely thinking of ordering more! Also, there weren't any tariffs, which is kind of irrelevant to the company but is just nice.",7

"The hoodie we got my daughter was far from the picture online. It looked really good online but when we FINALLY got it, the colors were horrible. It looked like a garage sale special we paid $50 for. No response from teepublic when we filed a PayPal claim, can���������t get anyone to answer me on a return. I���������d gladly send it back if ",7

"the colors of the print are all different from those published on the site ... the shirt is definitely less clear in the image and the similar colors are mixed together ... while on the site everything was very clear and above all not with similar colors mixed between them, where the main image is lost.This... It could also be called scam.",7
I���������ve ordered 6 shirts in the last 2 months and all have been great quality and exactly what I expected.��,7
I like this company and the fact that I am supporting local artists.My only negative is that shipping takes too long for the rates charged.,7

Great quality and unique designs. Super fast shipping.,7
"The shirt is exactly how it looks, although the shirt does run small, however the shirt itself is absolutely beautiful. I will definitely be buying agin from TeePublic!",7
The masks were shaped badly and not a good size. That's all I got in this order. The t shirts say they are on their way but much later than the estimated shipping time... So useless for the birthday I ordered them for. I ordered way ahead of time with many days to spare. I got the bigger kids size and they still fit really snug. The designs are great and we're super well received. Love the products I have gotten so far. I have yet to see the rest of my order from weeks ago.,7

"Excellent quality, fast shipping. This bluey shirt is amazingggggg.",7
"Product had marks on it, fuzz embedded in the clear coat and just not the quality I wanted for the price. Customer service never responded to my emails either",7
"To be honest, shipping took too long even under a Pandemic, the quality of the shirts is so-so and not worth $23, the print on one of them was peeling off after one wash.Also the amount of SPAM these people email you, it is unbelievable many emails every single day, not necessary!Will I come back? not until after this Corona crab is over then maybe.",7
Did a big order but didn't realize shirts were 100% cotton. Needed to upsize and they sent them out for free. Highly recommended for customer service!,7
"Great Shirts, Great Service, Great Company!!I found it just before Christmas....yeah!!",7
"TeePublic's products are great quality. I've ordered so many shirts from them, and they're all soft and comfortable. Also I love their sizing guide. It's very hard for me to buy clothes online that fit the first time, but they've somehow figured out the secret recipe���������understanding that there is indeed such a thing as different body types and sizes.I had one shirt that started fading really prematurely (like after only 4 months) and when I contacted their customer service, they immediately apologized and shipped me a new one. It was so easy and quick. They're going to get a lot more of my money in the future, provided their level of quality and serv",7

Always good quality and comfortable,7
Was on time good quality,7
I got the t-shirts I ordered. No issues at this time.,7
"My last communication about another shirt replacement was partially complied with but without the professional courtesy of any explanation or advice as to why it was partially and not fully complied with. That's one reason for one star.But with the latest replacement shirt (a 2XL) we at least could verify that the 2XL size is not like the L and the M sizes, that were in fact much too small and were identical in size and merely bearing different incorrect size labels, the 2XL that just arrived is in fact bigger and not so unreasonably far off the actual size that it should be. Not the style requested, so an explanation rather than ignoring that part of the request would have been the right thing to do rather than ignore the customer's communication on that part.TeePublic has never directly addressed the issue of the identical sizes of the L and the M that were received and I take that as an admission that you have a bad t-shirt supplier. But the coffee cups were good, although the shipping is pretty high and that is turning some other buyers off.",7
Accurate description of items & arrived quicker than expected,7
"The print is great, but the sizing is ridiculous. The size states a womens 3x, but it's like a 1x maybe.",7
Quality of shirt awesome delivery really fast kiddos,7

I still have not received 1 shirt I ordered the day before my big order. Who knows if I'll ever see that one. I have told numerous friends about teepublic and reccomend they never order from them.

"Ordered my product on September 8th; saw the tic to have it delivered by UPS for no extra charge. Thought I'd take advantage of it as a speedier means of receiving what I paid for. I was WRONG. Two days later I got the email that it was sent; but UPS had not even created a label or received the package for another six days. Then the package was immediately given to ""Mail Innovations"" to be sent through the USPS, and their station had not received the package for yet another four days. There it sat for about a week before it started moving. Then I get notice that it's next stop was Madison WI. Here, hoping I would get it soon checked the tracking, and Madison only got notice of it arriving. It got there another four days after and sat another three days before it was shipped to my hometown. All-in-all it took the better part of a month to receive it. When I contacted customer support, I got boilerplate and canned responses and told where I could check the tracking of the package. I mentioned that's where I got the info of it not even being delivered to the UPS or Mail yet, and got pretty much an ""oh well"". I order things from CA and Nevada from other countries that I receive in three days, there was no reason for this slow shipping and even less of a reason for the uncaring customer support.",7
"The quality of the material is very sturdy and comfy. I feel like it'll take much of whatever a day throws at it such as sweat, dirt, sun and the occasional oil stain. 10 out of 10 would buy again.",7
The quality of items are good. Not made of cheap stock but not super expensive either. Image on book purchased was clear and clean without printing errors or re-sizing distortions.,7
"I ordered three t-shirts. The soft t-shirt are a quality I expected. The designs...One is perfect. Looks great. Exactly as expected.One is ok (the logo appears to be worn a little on one side). Not a deal breaker, but I noticed. However, I don't think that is how it is supposed to look. One has the logo crooked. It's not even a complicated design, just a band name. Since I ordered using a nice discount, quality must not have been a concern.This is my first and last time using teepublic.",7

The first shirt arrived with a large stain on it. I sent a picture of the shirt to Tee Pubic and they immediately sent a replacement shirt. I am very impressed with the shirt and Tee Public's customer service.,7

Tried over a dozen times to rectify. Before the party���������.even wanted to order 13 or more on the reorder. Got BS generated responses with false promises. Mailed the entire box back. Worthless. Had to purchase from another company. Thing is I have over 1300 employees. This would have been huge. Instead, I got ignored. Documented each day since I have tried to fix. Awful. Turned out to be scammed. Went on social media. Found out I am not alone. Terrible reviews and similar reviews about",7

Ordered products that shipped from the USA. Arrived fairly timely (obviously not superfast but no delays). Love the badges and stickers! Great quality.,7

It took 2 weeks to get here and and the tracking number would not update might stay same for 2 or 3 days and not update. You didn't have a clue when it was going to be delivered. You look at it the day it delivered it showed the day before was last update . and it showed up at myhouse.,7

Awful the print design looks very cheap and rushed.Will not recommmend and will not change my review. Shame policy is no returns I have sent an email as well regarding this awful tshirt.,7
The shirts and the designs are great (for the most part)The site is brutal.There has to be someway of making the search function easier.,7

the tee shirt is very thin and the XL isn't a true XL.,7
My first package never arrived. Reached out to customer support and they shipped out a new one immediately and I received it not long after! Quality was great!,7
"As for customer service, in my experience TeePublic was top notch. I don't recall having had a prior series of communications with a seller where responses to my questions were offered within the day. I truly appreciated the stellar customer service. Unfortunately, I can't same the same about the quality of the product, in my case a hoodie. The first hoodie I ordered sported artwork that was off center. But beside the imprecision, I noted the subpar quality of the hoodie itself. For what I paid, nearly $40, I was expecting a thicker weave. But TeePubic did replace that hoodie with a different one: no extra charge. When the second hoodie arrived, the artwork was centered, but the ink/paint job lacked boldness, and again, the hoodie itself was thin and awkwardly sewn where the hood meets the shoulders; the hood flairs out resulting in a look more reminiscent of a cloak than an hoodie. Sadly, I won't place another order with TeePublic because of product quality. I wish, in good faith, I could write a different review, because I really did appreciate the customer service, but I think the public ought to know about the product itself.",7
Good shirt prices but shipping costs a lot,7
"Great designs! Amazing prices, 100% cotton, fast shipping! Very happy customer.",7
Excellent purchase and delivery experience.Products arrived quickly and quality was terrific!,7

"I knocked down the happy stars because this is the second time you've asked for a review. I already did one. The other thing is, the shirts are running smaller than the advertised measurements. I advise that you look again at your measurements.I hope I can give them as gifts to smaller people.Also, women need long sleeves in winter. That would have been nice.",7

I love the shirt it was a good quality shirt with a clear picture.,7
"Product took several days to ship, which is kind of annyoing, but overall wasn���������t a big deal and is understandable to an extent considering it probably was a one off production item. The shipping time took far longer than most products do. It wouldn���������t be a problem if shipping was free, but when it is billable, 3 days for a item of this size, weight, and packaging should be the longest. Also, this changed carriers from UPS to USPS, which added to delays and made tracking the package a cumbersome process.Overall, I love the product and quality of the item.

"Overpriced, Poor Quality. Six days to ship one shirt is OUTRAGEOUS! I paid an additional $19.99 (three times what the shirt is even worth) for expedited shipping and it was still sitting there a week later. The shirts are poor quality, don't try to wash it unless you intend to use it for doll clothes. I will NEVER do business with TeePublic again. You would be better off going to the mall.",7

The t-shirts are always top quality and they arrive quickly. The only quality issue I've ever had was with a pillow case (the corners were a bit wonky). I will continue to buy t-shirts from TeePublic.,7
The women's shirt are way too small and not anywhere true to size. I love the designs and the great prices. But I'm upset that I can't even wear the shirts I bought. I have them to my ten year old niece to wear.,7

Excellent material and the size fits perfectly. So satisfied!,7
"The masks I bought look nice and the print quality is good. However, the design is not form-fitting and doesn't fit an adult's head well (I have an avg sized nugget - not big in any way) - it is tight and small and does not follow the contours of the nose and chin. It is of poor design and it does not have a wire for the bridge of the nose either. So, as you speak in the small masks pulls down under your nose and you must constantly fiddle with it. I guarnetee these masks would fail a test for protection - but they look cool.",7
"Fast shipping, looks like quality products, true to size, great price!!",7
I would have loved the shirt...except the photo is pretty dark and blends in too much with the t-shirt color so that you can't see it that well.,7

Two of the 3 tees I purchased looked like concert bootleg prints. They all ready looked faded. I will stick with Teefury for my tee needs. You get what you pay for.,7
Too flimsy.Unable to use for a long time.Better if they were made of cotton.Waste of money,7
Everything arrived just as I had ordered it.,7
The artwork on the mug is not complete. The art stops just short of wrapping around the mug and instead has about a quarter inch black bar. I know this is not correct because I have the correct version. I also ordered a mask last year that arrived with a mark in the the artwork. That was replaced quickly.The point here is that there seems to be no quality control prior to sending out your products and that needs to change.,7
I bought a shirt and it was sent. I recieved tracking info in an email.,7
Super fast and easy service when it comes to making exchanges. Very pleasant representatives too!,7
Wanted this shirt for a while....love it!,7

The shirts look great even though I just received them on April 14th.I have not worn them yet but hope to do so soon.,7
I bought 1 size larger than I thought I needed for each person. Both shirts are about 3 sizes too small.*Edit to add - they were gifts and time was limited to give them. Sizing is difficult for gifts but I estimated for 1-2 sizes larger than I thought I would need. The XXL is about a M and the M looks to be a child���������s M-L.

"Service from the site was good; however, the quality of the screenprinting on my tee is poor. Low coverage = lack of vibrant colors.

They were quick to respond and provide some great assistance even during this holiday season. Honesty this was one of the best orders I���������ve placed from ease of placing to receiving the items. Amazing experience c,7
Everything arrived in good condition Tee shirts were great,7
Had an issue with my order and the customer service was top notch! I have ordered again with no issues. Very pleased with the product and service.,7
"I bought the October Girl tee shirt in maroon with black lettering.On the website it looked a lot better.In person it is difficult to read because it is to dark my other issue is the shirt smelled bad, had to wash so if it doesn't work out I can't return, but I had to wash it before really assessing it because the stench was horrific.",7
"I���������m still waiting for a piece of my order, but I didn���������t like that the sweatshirts arrived unwrapped in a box. It���������s cool to avoid plastic, but maybe some tissue paper woul",7
Your shirts run small and the cotton material will shrink,7
Great design and high quality product - we loved our show shirts for Mamma Mia!,7
One of the shirts the image is more to one side.,7
Honestly you guys took so long with my order and got the size wrong for the price I payed for I should���������ve got the size righ,7
Everything shipped quickly and sizes were accurate.i bought six different shirts all great quality.,7
I love your tees. Most times I can find that my thoughts are expressed in one of your tees. I gave a couple of them as gifts to my friends and they'realways amused and amazed.I get so many compliments. As for me I'm always happy and proud to wear them.,7
Great hoodie! Perfect gift.,7
Sweatshirt is not good quality. Colors do not match the picture. Frustrated that there that this cannot be returned. It was a gift that is unuseable.,7
I had a sizing issue and the customer service rep was fantastic and helped me get the proper size.,7
"A bit bigger than expected, but super cute and seems good quality. Paid for rush shipping and it came right on time.",7
"The quality of the shirt was great, but the image is printed off center.",7
Need to check your orders before you ship. My shirt has a HOLE in it. Looking forward to your customer service response so I can improve my rating.,7
"Great experience. Quality is outstanding. Material is a little heavy, and is not very breathable so in the summer it's a little hot to wear.",7
Overall the experience was better than expected. Everything fit as expected and according to the detailed sizing information provided. A price adjustment was performed after the purchase without question. My only issue is one of the items I received didn't last one wearing before developing a hole that is clearly due to a defect in how the garment was stitched.,7
"Quality, selection, value, shipping, communication were all first rate. I'll order again.",7
"I have made about a total of 4 orders and I am quite happy with how the designs look and they come out great, my only problem is that shipping does take a bit of time and that the inking can wear after a long period of time.The three shirts I've ordered have been comfortable, and the one hoodie I ordered wasn't as comfortable as the shirts.",7
Good quality and arrived much faster then expected. Sizes are appropriate,7
"The cotton is lightweight and flimsy. The order arrived two days late, so I was not able to take the shirts on my trip.",7
Colors were great and shipping was fast! Exactly as shown,7
"I've ordered from here a few times. Quick, high quality and easy returns if something is wrong",7
Still waiting on 1 order. I ordered 4 items and received 3 out of the 4. It's a Tote Bag I ordered and I was going to put all the other items in it for a Birthday Gift. I don't know when it will arrive. No date is given. The Birthday has already passed.,7
T-shirt is very thin and the design is crooked. Will not order merch from this site again.,7
Excellent product. It is Christmas present for a Neil Young fan. He should love it,7
The shirts feel good and the print is beautiful. They have a lot of images for you to select your perfect tee and I love this helps artists make money,7
Excellent service and excellent product. Will be a frequent customer.,7
I so love TeePublic! They have super creative designs and I love knowing that my shirt is so unique.,7

My order was correct and showed up fast.i was overall very pleased.i wouldn't have ordered up a size tho. In reviews it said they run small but I think the large was a tad to big.i would of ordered my normal medium size if all the reviews didn't say order up a size.even the option button said runs small on the site.i didn't think the v neck really ran small.but I loved all my tee shirts,7
"One of my shirts didn���������t print as well as I expected, definitely let the artist know if they are unaware. When I looked online I found that it was a detail I had missed and not a misrepresentat",7
Excellent work. Great designs. Have ordered twice and extremely happy with my purchase.,7
I love the concept of this T's on order but the order/delivery took soooooo long.,7
I love the F1 tshirt I bought and even though its custom/small batch it didn't cost a fortune. I did have to size up to a women's L but that was mentioned in the reviews.,7
Quality of product and timely delivery are greatly appreciated during these times. Great design great message,7
"Love the shirt I got and I will be getting more! I underestimated the size for my first order, but they replaced it quickly and easily. Great customer service and they really want to make sure you are happy with your purchase.",7
"I received my order and it was great as far as the appearance.I was very happy with that part as well as the fact that it arrived before Christmas!It just looks very small for a size medium.I am going to give it as a gift and then let the recipient decide if its too small.By the measurements he needed the medium.But after receiving it I have reservations as to whether it is going to fit. It truly looks like it runs on the smaller side, which after it has been laundered it will most likely shrink a bit.I will update this after Christmas.",7
"T-shirt was exactly what I wanted for a gift for my daughter. I initially selected the wrong size, and they helped me to make it right. Great customer service.",7

"I���������ve bought many things fromTee Public over the last many years- probably since they opened. They do a fantastic job. Quality is excellent, service is great, delivery is prompt. I just purchased 15 tees for cousins for Christmas. I���������m hoping ive got all the correct sizes but if anyone has an issue , from past experience, i know Tee Public will make it right. **My only complaint is that there are very limited colors once you get outside the ���������classic tee��������� categories. I really wish there were many colors in the softer fabrics and larger sizes. Come on Tee Public surely this is something yo",7
I ordered 2 shirts for my wife as a surprise just because gift. She was over the moon excited when she opened it up. She looks forward to wearing them when hallmark Christmas movie season starts.,7
"The shirts arrived quickly, were exactly as pictured and were very well made. Now, some day, I will be able to go to an Imax movie and, wearing my Cinerama t-shirt, I will be happy to explain what real widescreen used to mean. Beyond that dream, I am just happy to wear one of the greatest logos ever. The Toho Scope shirt was excellent, too. Great job. Thanks!",7
"UPDATE���������customer service has reached out and they are trying to make things right. Much appreciated! Shipping absolutely sucks, I���������ve made 2 orders both took over 2 weeks to arrive with little to no notice on when they���������d be delivered. My latest order they messed up on and didn���������t ship until I notified them over a week after placing. They offered 30% off my next full priced purchase��������� lame considering they have 35% off deals regularly, so in my opinion not much effort to keep repeat costumers.

"Flexibility: During a former purchase, a customer service rep emailed me regarding the lack of a certain size within their stock. They kindly gave me a few options to decide on what should I do before they ship. Cancel the order or wait till stock is refilled. I was surprised to know that they would notify me rather than find out after my order was shipped.",7

I bought this as a gift for a friend. He absolutely loves it. I did pay for expedited shipping but it came days earlier than I was expecting. I was very impressed with the delivery time. I���������ll defin,7
"Items arrived as ordered, a little earlier than estimated arrival date. The only weird thing was the way tracking is updated; while I got a tracking number, it's not fully integrated with the shipper so there was no record of the shipment until it had made its second stop on the route. Not really an issue, just something I haven't seen before. It was nice to receive both items ordered at the same time, even though they are from different artists.",7
The personal service is second to none. I mistakenly placed my order twice without realizing it and customer service alerted me to it.,7
Everything was handled well with my order. Very pleased.,7
"The shirt I ordered arrived promptly. Upon inspection, it was exactly the design, quality, and comfort I desired. The color combination of the design on this shirt is accurate to the original logo from the Dutch East India Company circa 1602. I was unable to find another product online matching this level of accuracy and quality. If there are more items from TeePublic I choose to get at a later date, I anticipate the same high level of satisfaction as this purchase. Much appreciated.",7

Found exactly what I wanted at a great price with fast shipping.Very pleased.,7
"My order was received within 1 to 2 weeks after placing order. Great sales price for merch & shipping fees. I took off 1 star because I recently placed two separate T-shirt orders with TeePublic. The first order was great, colors of designs were bright/bold, crisp with clean lines, perfect! Second order not so much. The colors were muted & dull on most. I double checked the website and I understand that the photos on the website don���������t always depict what the final product will look like especially with fabric. But there���������s definitely a disconnect in image featured on website & final product. This is my 5(?) order with TeePublic & I noticed the same with my March 2020 order. The Dukes of Hazzard T-shirt design was definitely blurry image& dull colors. The rest of the order was perfect. I would still definitely recommend TeePublic over any other online store due to its large selection of artist work, reasonable prices & extra large sizes. Customer service is excact company. Respond with 24-48 hours to my email. And solved my issue perfectly. Awesome company TeePublic!",7

"I ordered a women's small tshirt from TeePublic. I ignored the advice to order a size up. I am a size 2 and the women's small is wayyyy too tiny. It barely fit my 11 year old tiny daughter either. TeePublic had great online instructions to follow for returns, made a replacement order very simple, and my new order shipped out just as quickly as my initial one. The medium fits great! Print and color look as they do online.",7

Online it says size 2X womens one the garment it says XXL. These two sizes are not the same only through the sleeve, shoulder and length are they the same. A 2X is always made larger through the middle or girth so may I suggest on the website to write XXL instead of 2X.I've kept the shirts because luckily I've lost some weight and don't want to fuss with trying to exchange them.I'll still have ordered from you since for gifts but careful in choosing sizes.",7

"Takes a normal time to arrive considering im in New Zealand and covid, items are good quality shirts fit well some things don't do to well in the dryer overall very happy with this site very good communication also",7
"I have bought countless shirts from TeePublic. The prints are clean, durable, and wash well, and they are one of the few printers that have extended unisex sizes as well as extended women's sizes.Only once have I not gotten what I ordered, and in that instance they just sent the correct tee, no questions asked.My only wish is that I could create a favorites list, but I really don't need anymore tees. Yet...",7
"High quality products, wide range, and great customer service",7
"Speedy delivery, great quality t.shirtand fab designs !",7
T-shirt came quick and as ordered,7
Elastic is way too loose. I had to resew the masks so that they actually function as a protective barrier.,7
"I loved everything. Awesome stuff, awesome options, easy to order.",7
"My hoodie is beautiful quality, I will definitely buy from this site (and particularly the artist I purchased from) again! This artist's art style is fantastic and they design a lot of things from shows I love, and you can customize the design to go on pretty much anything. I'm absolutely in love!",7
"Everything���������.seriously everything.Best quality, best designs and best ",7
Reliable service. Good product. Timely delivery.,7
"This is the second time I've ordered t-shirts from TeePublic, and I'm just as happy with the products. Unfortunately, it seems prices have gone up a little bit though (just like everywhere else). I also ordered shirts that only shipped from Canada this time, and they got here much faster. One thing I learned from this most recent order was a relief and also extremely annoying. Sometimes when I would put a shirt in my cart, it would say the item couldn't be shipped from Canada, so the shipping cost went up. I thought it was the t-shirt design that wasn't available in Canada, but it's actually the COLOUR. In my previous order, I bought a shirt that could only be shipped from the US, so I had to pay extra shipping (and then customs fees) to get it. I only found out making this order that I could've ordered the same design, but changed the shirt colour slightly, and it would've shipped from Canada. It would've saved me $36! It's nice to know I can get any design I want (maybe not in the exact colour I want), but I wish TeePublic would let the customer know it's the shirt colour that can't be shipped from Canada, not the design.",7
I bought 2 Civil War masks and my husband loved them!Beautiful work!!,7
"Cute designs, thin shirt with thin plastic fuse on plastic. One trip in the dryer will start this peeling like a sunburned banana.",7
"This was my first time ordering from Tee Public.I ordered two shirts.The shirts were good quality and the printing looked nice.The fabric was a little on the thin side but acceptable.Delivery took about two weeks, a little slower than other on line retailers but tee public was up front about the delivery time so this was expected and not a problem.Overall a good experience and I���������d orde",7
Quick shipping.Got here sooner than expected.,7
"very good. shirts. the shirts i got were what i wanted, all in the size i wanted. they are soft feeling and look very good quality. I have only washed them once so far, inside out, as the tag recommends.",7

"Great shirts, great service & fast shipping! I highly recommend!",7
Product was as advertised and shipping as promised.,7
"I love all the designs that are hard to find on other websites , the tee shirts always fit and roomy where other shirts from other sites are to tight to wear , and delivery is always speedy. And I love to show off these sidings when I go out , to share with the world .",7
"Loved the design and print quality. If you are a woman, you may want to order 1-2 sizes up. The medium fits like a small and I am 34D and 115 lbs. I will order a Large next time just to feel more comfortable.",7
'Set's of pin badges all too dark and not the design advertised.It is very difficult to complain about anything unless you write all this out and then lucky if it's put up. Not very happy at all with a large 'Tapestry' I ordered...I still have not had it delivered to me after months of date of order.,7
I purchased 2 Cobra Kai tees one for myself one for a gift one tee is great. One arrived with a sticker stuck to the shoulder that left a sticky residue that���������s will not come off. The tee is not wearable.,7
"The shirt and graphic quality are both superb, only complaint is that I wish the graphic was bigger, it's a pretty small square in the center of the shirt.",7
I wanted a gift for my Mustang loving friend and most of the memorabilia ifound was too cute or too gaudy. The sleek black and white mugs were a great clean design - and a hit with my friend.,7

"I got this for my sister's birthday. Honestly, I may go back and get one for myself!She said it's gorgeous and perfect for her. It arrived within the time frame I paid for, and there was no damage. It looks like the picture, although the fabric is thinner than what I would normally think of for a tapestry, it looks perfect and makes it easier to hang.",7
The tee shirt was very thin and low quality,7
The trifold blend really IS as soft as i'd hope! After one wash the tackiness of the decal went away. Very satisfied with my purchase and experience.,7
High quality and nice color.Exactly what I wanted.,7

Good product. And shipped in a timely manner,7
"I Love the variety and efforts of all the artists, Great quality and prices!",7
"Loved the quality, selection, price and customizing on the women���������s hoodies I purchased. Also received excellent",7
"Loved the look of the masks.Unfortunately that's about all I can say that is good about them.The ""lining"" material (that is actually on your skin) is so thin that when you inhale through your nose it causes quite an obstruction. This material conforms to the nose, like tape, which makes breathing more than difficult.The other issue with the masks is that the 2 layers of material are not sewn together on either side.This may be part of the problem with the ""lining"" being inhaled.I also believe that a different type of material should be used for the ""lining"".I was so excited to receive these masks because the 2 I chose (Lucy & Golden Girls) are my favorite shows.I'm hoping to find someone who can rework these masks to make them wearable.",7

I love the design and I keep getting lots of compliments and laughs about the shirt.I also love the material.It's super soft and comfortable and the cut is very flattering.,7
"This was a Christmas gift for my husband and he doesn���������t like Christmas, so he is very hard to shop for. I had ordered the shirt from Walmart, it came shipped from China. I ordered a men���������s large and they sent a woman���������s small. I took it back to Walmart and went back online to find an American company to get it from.That���������s when I found your company, the shirt arrived in record time, was beautifully made, and was great quality. I",7
Large nxys shirt is really small for large,7
"We ordered several tee-shirts and stickers and they all arrived promptly and seem well made. The size charts were helpful and accurate too, so everything fit. (My daughter is usually a girls large, 10-12, but the youth Medium fits her well, not too huge, but with room to spare. I'm usually a women's small or medium but the advice to size up to a large was spot on.) My daughter was super excited about her Hadestown shirts! We'll be ordering more in the future for sure.",7
"I really like the theme I picked out and was surprised to find it. Mail time was super slow and took two weeks to receive, but that not your fault. Problem I have is it was rather difficult to insert the rubber sleeve onto the plastic case and get it all onto the plastic lip. I was somewhat surprised there was no additional screen protector included as well. And, removing it from the phone was not easy either. I will be using this cover when I���������m not outdoors as its somewhat slippery and offers very little protect",7

always good A+,7
"The design was really faded on my sweatshirt, I know it supposed to be retro, but it is hard to read and I have not washed it yet... unlike the picture online.

"The shirt that came in was exactly what i wanted. However, it took way too long for the item to get to me. I ordered the item on 5/8 and didn���������t get a confirmation or tracking number until 5/22. When I finally got the tracking number it was through UPS which was great because I know they always ship super fast. Little did i know that this super fast service was thwarted by the fact that it had to go through another courier (USPS) to finally get to me. Instead of it arriving on 5/30, I had to wait until 6/5 just to get one shirt. Almost a whole month for my one item to get to me. Simply unacceptable, considering I had to ask UPS where my package was and only to be informed that it was ",7

"Submitting art is very easy. However, recently I had to go through my entire storefront to correct many errors in design placement, products being turned off, etc. Also, getting fan art approved and not removed is hard. I make nothing but fan art, and a lot of it gets flagged when other artists are allowed to sell similar images. Lastly, a few of my images were stolen and being sold by other artists. The TeePublic team was quick to correct this and I appreciate it :)",7

I love the pillow and the artwork on the t-shirts I got but sadly the t-shirts are not printed properly. The artwork on one of them was supposed to be centered but is quite noticeably off center.

Everything on the site was clear except for a little confusion on the sizes of some of the items.,7
"Would have given a better rating if they had sent me the right size shirt. I am a big guy, and the whole reason I ordered from this site is that it offers 5x size. I specified that in my order and they sent me the wrong size shirt. If I try to wear it I will look like a manatee Hooters waitress. Seriously, how hard is it to NOT mess up the SIZE selection?",7

"Such a great company. The shirts I ordered were made from quality stock T-Shirts. The prints were vibrant and look like they last a while. Normally when I order shirts from an unknown vendor I usually order a size up because if they come from oversees they run a little small. These shipped from the US, and are true to size.

I love my shirts and my neighbors wanted to know gave them your email. It also came a day early..,7
"This is an update to my review from August 26: Despite TeePublic's reply here that they respond to 100% of all support requests, I have reached out to them again since posting my review - by email, website support request form and live chat - and still have not heard back from them. My order number: 11698649. TeePublic: do the right thing here and follow up to resolve this issue.",7
"I'll just show you my last email to Teepublic.Here's the thing, the product is not the same. The reason why I ordered so much is that I thought I knew what I was getting then you gave me something different. I don't like these shirtsbecause they ' re not even Teepublic shirts. Could you please answer my question? Do you still sell the shirts with the Teepublic logo printed on them or do you only sell Bella Canvas now? Honestly I don't even care that much about the art of the shirts, it's nice don't get me wrong. ButI really like the cut, size , fit and look your your previous product. This is the reason why I order from Teepublic multiple times a year. When you say it's a business decision do you mean that you 're cutting costs by outsourcing?If so I really feel ripped off. Building trust and then breaking customer loyalty to save money is the worst business decision you could make. You used to be so good. I had a problem with sizing before and they sent me a free hoodie one size up. This is the same problem.Please respond to this question in particular>I really like the cut, size , fit and look your your previous product.Do you still sell the shirts with the Teepublic logo printed on them or do you only sell Bella Canvas now?Also the tri blend material on the Bella Canvas shirts is not as soft as the tri blend on the Teepublicshirts. Also I really don't like the tags. The fact that you had the information printed on the previous shirts was a big plus for me.I really don't want theseshirts and I would like to do an exchange if you still have any shirts with the Teepublic logo printed on them. I really don't care the money I wasted. I'm just depressed to see that my favorite shirts are no longer available to me. And i'm wondering if there are any left.",7

There is part of one name that is simply not there. You can tell that this is an iron on transfer and there must be a wrinkle in it or something because it���������s the same on both shirts.

I ordered 4 shirts for my daughter for Christmas and I ordered the wrong size they exchanged the shirts with no hassles and they arrived quickly,7
I received three jackets. I ordered one and it was too small so I bought a bigger one to replace it. Then I realized you exchange jackets so I got a size down to try to see if it will fit. The 4x came and its still floats on me. The 3x I couldn't zipper up. I had to buy something 2 sizes way too big to even wear it.,7
Design was great! We have the same paint job on ours! Only ours is a 1972.,7
Easy pick out of many unique designs. Good quality.,7

"So far terrible...I own approximately 100 T-Shirts, this will be the worst quality by far and the fit is horrible. Sleeves are shorter than anything I've ever experienced, the torso was much smaller than size chart, and the neck line weak and floppy. No resolution to the problem yet after sending complaint and requested photo's 2 days ago",7

My Krampus shirt has a ton of lines and streaks throughout the graphic. The text on the shirt is even really blurry and not very crisp. Back in the day, TeePublic would never ship out something that was made horribly. Now it seems like they don���������t care anymore. We may not be ordering fro",7
Very happy with the transaction with this company - with one exception. UPS transfers the purchased item to the US Mail system. That���������s bad.

"The print on the cover of the book was off so far that the info that should have been on the binding was on the back of all the books I ordered. Some of the Titles were over the edge and the front cover had a strip of plain color to fill where the image ran out. It could have been fixed by simply cutting where they should have off of the original print. I would send them back, but I really don't feel like messing with the charges. The books themselves were of fine quality. That is the only reason I am giving 2 stars.",7
Great Quality tees! my boys loved them all,7

"Ordered 3 t-shirts last week and they arrived in 7 days. Pretty decent considering they came from an American site. The design options were brilliant and loads to choose from. I was a bit concerned at the amount of colours each one was available in because I thought it might have just been a cheap t shirt with a stick on design that would come off after a few washes. However I was really pleased when they arrived. They're good quality tops and really comfy. The designs aren't really something you find in a shop, so they are pretty unique. Pretty good value all round for me.",7

"The artist stole the image. Deplorable. THEN they charged me as if they owned it, twice as bad! Not only did they rob who they took the image from, but me as well!

My chest measurement is 33 inches, and the shirt was fitted but not too tight with the size medium.",7

I am very pleased with one of the t-shirts.Had this been the only t-shirt, my review would have been 5 stars.The lettering on the second t-shirt is thin, making it look faded or washed out looking.This is the reason for the lower rating.These are a gift.

The tee shirt I ordered is an XL. I ordered it large for comfort and for a sleeping shirt. This is the smallest XL I have ever witnessed. It appears to be more a standard small-medium.Makes me think it's sent from China where regular expectations are now known.,7

"The quality has deteriorated over the years. Every t-shirt I get now, the quality of the print is REALLY bad, and peels off within several washes.I feel bad because the designs are REALLY great, the tshirts themselves are good quality and soft, and the prices and deals are great, but the quality is REALLY bad and wastes your money completely. (Yes I've gotten replacements, no change in quality)",7
Designs are awesome. Service is unbelievable. Bogdan was great.,7

Lack of communication from customer service. Please do not contact me to see how you can improve. I don���������t care to proceed past this.

Excellent shirts. Just what I ordered!,7
"I love the designs that are available. In the past I've had good experience with both customer service and quality of product. However the last batch of shirts I ordered was not as good as I am used to receiving from you. The print quality does not seem as good, and the tee itself (the soft ladies tee) seems like it's made out of different fabric. I hope that I won't continue to see downgrades in quality.",7

My daughter loved the shirts. Good quality & sizing. My only issue was that there was no way to check tracking or processing info until it was to be shipped. Maybe it's because the site seems to work like a co-op. That would be my only suggestion.,7

Absolutely amazing experience and one of a kind designs for diehard fans of whatever you���������re interested in. It���������s the Reddit of Apparel! I�����,7
Lettering was extremely blurry and not clear at all. Definitely was not worth 20$...,7
I loved the face masks I ordered and will order more!!,7
They gave me what I needed in a timely manner which was good. The quality though is something that I think I can make myself. Looks like they spent $5 on the shirt that I got for $25 and just slapped the print (that isn't the sellers art work)onto a gildan t-shirt that I can get for 25������. If you're just looking for a basic shirt I guess I would recommend buyin,7
Tshirts arrived as expected. Love them and I am sure my Grandson will as well .,7
"Website was easy to navigate. order came on time , good quality materials and print. This is my second time ordering on this site and definitely not my last.",7
"I've used them before and loved it, but lately their product quality is garbage. Every single item ordered has been at least 4 inches off in size, and the shirt is uneven and poor quality.So they send you a replacement to fix it, but the exact same problem happens again.I've ended up with 4 of the same shirt that I can't wear. Simple fix would be to MANUALLY CHECKyour product. Pretty sure I'm done doing business with them.",7

The print was off center so I feel the job was rushed.,7
"The tee shirt is OK, but the mask is a joke! It must be made for a child. It certainly won't fit an adult. It's also very cheaply made.I should get a refund for that...plus the shipping cost (shirt and mask came in 2 separate shipments.",7
The t-shirt I ordered was quickly delivered at a great price. It was exactly as I pictured it. Great quality. Would order again for sure!,7
Always get fast shipping. The trees are awesome.,7
"I ordered a gift for my wife and it disappeared into the shipping abyss. I didn���������t want to hassle anyone because I know these are crazy times, and when I reached out a week after Christmas a replacement was sent immediately, no questions asked. The original order eventually showed up and now I feel bad like I ripped off a small independent company. You guys are awesome, we all got",7
No customer service . Trying to exchange 2 tee shirtsfor larger size and they NEVER respond. Will never order from them again.,7

Not much of an online shopper but this was an easy process. May do more online .,7
The shirt is amazing as someone who's nickname is Dodo it was perfect. Fits great which is rare for someone my size and of course the art the best part. Kudos to the artist and TeePublic foe helping me find this shirt!,7

"While unfortunately the hoodie I ordered was sized weird, once I emailed customer service, their response was quick and most helpful with the defect.

No complaints! So recommend!,7
"Great product, arrived fast after ordering. Very pleased with my order.",7
Delivery to be Canada Post as item ships from Canada. I found out that none of this is correct. Item is from the US and shipping by UPS who still haven't given an update or even an estimate of delivery. Last order said shipping from Canada and it was.

"This feels like a t-shirt version of deviant art, I have rarely been let down by w/e random idea I hope an artist has submitted.

I ordered three more in June but, they shrank a bit after washing them. Company policy enabled me to request one size larger and I offered to return the originals. Now comes the best part.On 7/6 Alexandra emailed me to ask my new size and how many I wanted. I replied and asked for return instructions. I soon received 2 replacements.On 7/8 Andreea emailed explaining that one color was no longer available and gave me a link to order an alternative. I did so and soon received the alternate.The alternate arrived and, to my surprise, a note inside said that I needen't return the originals and suggested that I donate them.

I ordered 4 different colored 2x female cut shirts- I normally wear an x-large-1x but they advise you to order 1-2 sizes up. I ended up needing a 3x and theexchange was super easy but still tight in the armpits and unfortunately you dont have the full color range when you go that big and you pay more even though the 3x is no bigger than a mans 1x. Overall I love the concept and the customer service. Brown stretches nicely but beware of other colors running small.,7

So I sent pics of the shirts with measurements and the lovely customer service people were quick to rectify the situation. The XL fit and my mum is very happy.Negatives/room for improvement: So shipping raises drastically if they don't have the prints in australia ready. While this is fine, maybe a toggle or an option while looking at colours and designs so I did not have to go back and forth through the shipping screen for every iteration to see if the shipping has skyrocketed. Also we did follow the sizing guides so I think they need to update them.",7

"Easy ordering, sizing fit true-to-size, quality is great, soft tee",7
The designs were slightly faded.Especially on the white shirt.,7
"I love the t-shirt designs, but the t-shirts themselves feel cheap. When I washed and dried them, they shrunk and wrinkled around the neck quite a bit. As for the stickers, they seemed pretty low quality for the price of $2.50. It was clear that they had just been printed on sticker paper from a medium quality file. I want to like your products, and they look great online, but in the flesh they need some work.",7
"Excellent product. Shirt came out nice. Shipping took a bit longer than expected, but since everything is crazy right now due to COVID, it���������",7
I love my t-shirt and I got it the very next day!,7
Perfect fits. True to description.,7

Loved the design and quick turn around! Shirt is super soft but may be short for a tall person.,7
"Great tee shirts, I have a tall skinny 13 y/o who wears xs but the small worked great! The size lg racerback tank I bought for myself was a little more fitted than I prefer but it still fits, material is thinner as well. Love the designs on everything!",7

I was looking for New Mexico astronomy-related tee shirts for my grandchildren but found some wonderful New Mexico Land of Enchantment shirts.The quality is superb and I will surely order more from your company in the future.,7

"Shirts arrived fairly quickly and they looked great. Fabric was good as well. The women's shirts run small, so do order one size up to get it right.",7
"Crap quality, overpriced. Will never buy from them again!",7
Honestly Tee Public is not for me. Their tee shirts are longer than any competitor. If you like ordering a shirt and receiving a summer dress Tee Public is for you.,7

"I am a repeat customer and have purchased from Teepublic over the years.This time, a 5-star rating is deserving! They now use the Gildan brand of cotton tees (at least for male sizes) which simply fit me better, are thin enough for the hot climate I live in, and are more consistent in sizing. Love it, Teepublic!Shipping was economical only when more tees are purchased. Australia Post exceeded expectations and I received my tees faster than expected.Overall, I am most pleased, and would return for more. Keep it up, Teepublic! Yay!",7
"Well designed tee shirts that feel soft (if you pay for the soft cotton variety) and comfortable. The sizes run a bit small, but this is a very good product.",7
"Teepublic is amazing! I keep coming back again and again to see all the new, creative artwork they have. I specifically go to ""alhern67"" since that artist keeps always adding to an already impressive portfolio of unique designs.",7

I look forward to doing more business with them for years to come!",7
"I absolutely love TeePublic. I'm picky about my shirts, they need to be well made and comfortable. TeePublic checks those boxes, and they have every design you could want",7

"I ordered the ""heavy"" (more expensive) T-shirts for my family and they were quite thin. I expected more of a ""beefy T"" but they were more like the dollar general. The graphics seemed nice but I have not washed them. First time for TeePublic and sadly the last.",7
When I ordered the TEE Shirt I paid for expedited shipping.I placed the order on April 2nd and received it on April 15th. I would not call that expedited!!I ordered this as a birthday gift for our daughter and ordered a size up like the website suggested.I ordered a women's large and it looks like a child's large.I like the shirt and the color is just right but she can't wear it!!!!,7

Always satisfied with my orders. If theres ever a mistake its always taken care of at no cost to me!,7
I ordered two shirts and they came in such a reasonable time. Will definitely order from them again!,7
"Awesome product!! As advertised, would order from vendor again!",7
The quality is poor. I expected the quality to be quite nice since they���������re about three times higher than any of the other masks that I���������ve seen out there. It looks as if the design has been printed from a sublimation printer onto a plain piece of fabric. It makes the design look fuzzy rather than crisp.The ear straps are uncovered elastic. The entire structure seems hastily sewn together. Will not buy again,7
A good face mask of doctor who took a while to arrive in the UK found it on doctor who fan page on Facebook,7

Very good quality product. Not happy with the cost to get it shipped quickly. It cost almost as much as the product.,7
"I have always been happy with my purchases, and keep coming back for more. If you have any issues, their customer service is amazing and accommodating. My only issue is that most of their designs on their shirts are so big, and if they had the prints smaller, I would buy more.",7

Nice T-shirts however sizing is a major problem! They are difficult to give as a gift with out taking the recipients specific measurements. I ordered and just received a 2XL for someone who would normally wear an XL and my initial assessment is that it will still be too small. If ordering measure the recipient or order 3 sizes larger than you normally would.,7

"This is our second order from Teepublic. We were really impressed with the first one, so happily ordered 4 more t-shirts. However, this time the quality of the printed images is terrible. One t-shirt doesn't even have the colour it's meant to have. As they're ordered from abroad, there's no incentive to return them for our money back. We just won't order from them again. UPDATE Teepublic got in contact promptly and have sent a replacement and offered a refund for another tshirt. Their customer service is clearly very good and I will just wait to see what the outcome is.",7

"The 2 lego shirts were great... good quality shirt, good quality print.A week and a half to get them here seems a lot. I thought the Covid delays were over.Maybe they only print each shirt after it was ordered to avoid waste... I don't know but that's why 4 stars.",7

I was really pleased with the fit and softness of the Men's Tri-Blend T-Shirt that I got for my boyfriend.",7

"I have to say that quality t-shirts with local city and area names are getting harder to find. Yes, there are the local shops with the heat transferred (iron-on) appliqu������s, but those do not last. I questioned the TeePublic support team about the appliqu������s on the two t-shirts I purchased and they skillfully explained the state-of-the-art transfer processed they used. I am very happy with my purchase. The quality",7
"The tshirts came, and were great! My hubby loved them!",7
"Great product, delivered with haste.",7
"The designs were accurate as far as the subject goes. Mine were both aviation related. The placement of the print is excellent on the shirt. The lettering is elegant and fit the main subject of the shirt very well. Ordering was simple, and the site itself was easy to navigate. My favorite feature was the ease of going through the t shirt colors and deciding what you like best.",7

"Shirts are super thin material unless you chose premium which is more expensive.I feel like many of the ppl they use to print the shirts are either amatures or very careless.I received 4 shirts and 2 had very crooked prints. So bad they were un-wearable. Teepublic's policy is no refunds and only replacement of the original print, so the replacement may be as bad or worse than the original.

One is a long sleeve shirt with the Mayflower ship (an interest and hobby of mine.) The second shirt is short sleeve, my all time favorite TV show Mchale`s Navy. You can choose the size and many colors. I am very pleased with the quality price and service. Rick from NC",7
"I ordered from Canada. I paid way too much for shipping, but I really wanted the tees so I bit the bullet. Then I got hit with a duty fee costing more than any one of the shirts cost. Then, when I received my overpriced shirts, the transfers were all bad. They looked like they had already been through the wash a bunch of times. I won't be using TeeRepublic again.",7

"I bought a Minnie's Haberdashery shirt for my brother's birthday and had it shipped directly to him. He loved it, but told me he couldn't make out all the words due to the print being so light. I contacted customer service with a message and photo later that evening, and by noon the following day I got a response apologizing and letting me know a new shirt is being printed with darker imaging and shipped ASAP. I couldn't be more pleased with the hastiness and efficiency correcting my problem. 2 thumbs way up.",7
"I ordered two tees with the same print. I checked the online description before I purchased and they were both supposed to be 100% cotton, but one was not. The image on the non-cotton one was not printed even half as clear or bright as the cotton one, and neither were as vivid as the design displayed online. I have sensory issues and am unhappy with the polyester one. The sizing matched the size charts fairly well, but I apparently still need them both to be 1 size smaller because the neck holes are too huge, and the lengths are too long. The color selection is basically just black for curvy sizes.",7

The designs onthe shirts are great!! The sizing however runs very small. The child shirt size I picked was based on a 4-7 year old but it is more like a 3T.I bought bigger than usual in the women���������s t shirts as well and they are extremely small.The men���������s,7
"I placed my order on December 3rd. It's the 22nd, and so far only one of the four things I ordered has arrived. (They were sent in three separate shipments.)

My account was canceled, no payments were made to me for my sales, none of my emails were answered as to why, and when I received my most recent batch of shirts, the print quality was terrible. Much lighter and almost see through, unlike previous orders I've had. Overall really disappointed with my most recent experience and will be taking my business elsewhere.",7
Returning the shirt. While it is very cute-it is very very small for what is supposed to be a women���������s size large-this is more like a child size large.

these shirts were perfect exactly as shown and nice quality fabric not too thick so they can still be worn in the Texas summer heat they arrived in a very timely manner also,7
"I like the quality of the print on the shirts, but sometimes the white base on the black shirts shows around the edges. The top colors are just a hair off center from the base. It's not a huge problem but it could be better. And it doesn't happen on every shirt, just a small percentage in my experience.",7
I am very please the the quality of the tee shirts I ordered. They have such a large selection of colors and sizes I was able to find a shirt foe everyone!,7

Shirts arrived The tees were perfect and we were the talk of the stem cell unit.Then we had to order a few more!",7
Site is easy to navigate.Delivery was prompt.I guessed wrong on the size but that's not Jos. A Bank's fault.,7
I love the design of the shirts and my order got to me pretty quickly. The sizing also seems accurate. The only thing I disliked was that the quality of the shirts isn���������t great. I know there were options on softness of fabric but for the price I think even the lowest quality offered should be a little softer than this. Other than that my exp,7
Awesome designs.Good price. Big fan,7

I wanted to wear something to the opening of Avengers Endgame on the 26th that had Stan Lee and I found the perfect shirt. I didn't want a shirt that said good bye to him (of which there are plenty), but rather a design that invokes happiness when anyone sees it. This design shows Stan Lee's own passion for life and for his life's work--which will truly live on forever.",7

TEEPUBLIC was amazing. I ordered tee shirts for my third grade teaching team. A couple of t shirts did not fit the teachers. They were incredible with exchanging our sizes too get ones that fit!!! We had another team mate that decided he wanted a shirt. They added the shirt and replaced the others at the original cost and refunded the shipping! I will definitely use TEEPUBLIC again for our t shirt needs!!!,7
My son really liked it I think I might have got it a little small. I'll be able to dry it in the dryer.,7

"Great turn around , great merch and reliable.",7
quality products which are unique and personally satisfying,7
They are nicely printed shirts but there is a tackiness to the print!Otherwise perfect!,7

"Great designs, Great shirts... GREAT prices... what more can I say?",7
"Overall this product is exactly as described. It didn���������t turn out as bright and colorful as pictured though, I think due to stretching the fabric for a laptop case size. It���������s also a pretty snug fit with no room for any charger/accessories. A great sleeve to store a lap",7
Received the short promptly. Loved it,7
"Very, very NIICCEEEE!!!",7
T shirt is way too thin.Print is way too light colored.,7
Wrong size came. (Tagged as proper size but measured smaller.) They immediately sent another. It was also smaller than tagged. TeePublic sourced a different 3rd party supplier and sent again. Great customer service!,7
The design is stitched into the side and it's very poorly made. Really a waste of money and is useless.,7
"Shirts were ordered intime for a concert, but they were not delivered in time.Wasted 50 dollars, and was given a 30% off my next purchase.But with their time being so unreliable, there will not be a next purchase",7

Arrived way earlier than I thought it would be and it was printed really nicely! I ordered it oversized and it came as just tha! Pleasant to work with and trusted :),7
"I love the shirt... however, the sizing chart is not accurate. I wear a large tee shirt. So, I ordered an extra large to be certain I could wear it.Your extra large was too tight for me to wear it. I am 5'11"" and weigh 200 pounds and your extra large was too small and tight to wear.",7
Your shirts run TOO small. There's no way a 2XL should fit like an L. Never ordering from here again.,7

"The adult small sweatshirt I ordered was REALLY small. Definitely a women's small, not a men's small. I looked everywhere for a size chart before I ordered but couldn't find one so I made my best guess. I definitely would have sized up if I had seen a size chart. The graphic is not very vivid on a black sweatshirt. It just kind of blends in. Isn't there another layer you can add in the printing process to make colors pop? The lettering is tiny and just isn't as impressive as it was on the screen. If I had seen it in person I would not have purchased it.",7

"Item was shipped quickly and arrived in good shape but very low quality t shirt. Extremely thin fabric and after one wash, badly misshapen. As far as the design goes, it's a cheap heat transfer that is kinda of fuzzy or blurry and was applied crooked. I've bought much higher quality t shirts in parking lots after concerts for half the money.",7
"Amazing quality, fast service and delivery! Love it!",7
I was looking for a Genshin Impact cup for my grandson. I finally found a microwaveable and dishwasher safe mug at TeePublic.,7

Easy buying process and was shipped/delivered in a reasonable amount of time coming from USPS. 10/10 recommend!!,7
"It was my first order from TeePublic and I always have a few hesitations when it comes to ordering clothing online. However, when I received my t-shirt, it was true to size, soft and clean, and the print looked great! Only thing is the shirts with a print on them tend to have a vinegary smell but that's nothing the first wash won't get rid of. I would make more purchases from TeePublic again!",7
"This tee is beautifully done and fun and arrived quickly. I couldn't be more pleased. And I love your business model, giving those of us who are small and independent a platform.",7
T-shirt quality was really great for the price I paid! The shirts came in a week. Would definitely order from TeePublic again.,7

Your product was a gift . I never saw it but I understand the recipient lived it . Delivery was another story. It was a 17 yr old girl trying to appease her abusive dadand make some good vibes . He complained she doesn't care about him and was not nice despite her telling him she has a present on order . Then tracking said like 5 days in a row expect by 9pm ( tomorrows ) date . Never showed and again a new delivery date the day after and the day after for 5 days and dad got even pissier . The product waswell received but shipping ate away at it over time . Try a different shipper .,7

Very nice quality,7
"Very nice! Product arrived on time, was securely packaged & was exactly as described by seller.",7
I ordered two shirts as Christmas presents. One I am happy with and will be gifting. The second one to look at straight forward it hurts the eyes you have to look at the lettering at an upward angle in order to see it clearly. I am now shopping for a different gift and wasted my money on this shirt!!,7
I would have given it 5 stars but the mask is to small for male adult. The print on it was awesome. They just need to be a little bigger.,7
Order was prompt And a good buy. Very pleased,7

Ease in ordering and got just what I wanted.,7
"I knew exactly what I was looking for, and I was pleasantly surprised to see so many color options for the same design. The package eventually came in a bag with a great design. I was a happy camper all around with the process.",7
"I was really looking forward to this shirt as I loved the design. When it arrived I couldn't believe it. It was blurry and you could barely make out what's in the picture. To add to that, the size is off. I buy that same size shirt all the time as they are usually a little big on me, like I like them. This one was skin tight. And apparently I can't return it as the design on the shirt is specific to me and if I want a different size, they'll have to redo the shirt. Not happy with this at all. 20+ dollars wasted.",7
"I made my review through the other page, because the quality of my Hoodie was really bad.",7

I ordered 5 shirts online for my husband and I. The turn around time for delivery was excellent and the shirts were all good quality and exactly as advertised. We have received many compliments on them and couldn't be happier with our experience. We are particularly happy that TeePublic supports individual artists and has such a vast selection of amazing products that appeal to almost anyone. We won't hesitate to place an order in future!,7

Great shirt!,7
The shirts had a smell of vinegar.Otherwise good quality of prints.,7
Excellent customer service. Even when the customer makes a mistake and there is a problem they will make it right. TeePublic will stay with you every step of the way until the customer is satisfied.,7
My package of 5 tee shirts didn't arrive even though UPS said it was delivered at 6:50 a.am.Tee public has said it would reship order at no cost.That is absolutely amazing in this day and age!Awesome people there!,7
Travel mug came with wrong lid for a second time. Seems to be a trend.,7
"I like that the shirt I bought was printed on a CANVAS shirt---likely the best quality T-shirt material out there. The printed colors were vibrant and the design so fresh, that my wife commented that it is probably her favorite of my T-shirts.",7
Good quality.Timely delivery,7
"Good site , ill be back",7
"I love my shirt, need to orders others I like!!Great service, I even love your packaging!!Please keep me on your email list!��������",7
The imprint size on this tee is misleading. I ordered an adult size medium shirt and wasn't expecting the imprint to be so LARGE. I wish it was much smaller just like the example photo shows on your website.,7

"Hi,not sure why printing is not crisper and more defined,I have had many shirts done that were bolder,the orange shirt printing looks very faded already out of the box.Maybe your process is different than other suppliers ????WINDY URTNOWSKI",7

"I have used TeePublic twice now for sending adorable t-shirts to my 3 young grandsons over the past few months, and I have to say I could not be more satisfied! The design choices are so extensive and so reasonably priced, the most difficult part of the process has proven to be narrowing down my choice to one per boy!I especially love how easy it is to navigate the website. Whenever I plug something specific into the search bar, I'm taken immediately to (tons!) of suggestions that are actually relevant to what I want. I definitely can't say the same for the other sites I've tried in the past. TeePublic is my company of choice from here on out!",7
Extremely unsatisfied The material of the sweatshirt that���������s supposed to be black it looks brown that���������s how off-color it is the T-shirts that I ordered large they seem like an extra small I would not order again from ,7

Very great quality and great at letting me know when my other was shipped and in track of it.,7
Good seller. Got the item as promised.,7
Cheap goods for expensive money. Bad pressure. Never again.,7
"I was emailed a ""how did we do?"". Which simply linked me back to the site home page. Hardly personal. And have yet to receive a response to my feedback on my issue -3 of 3 women's shirts have sizing issues- rendering them $13 or $20 paint rags. With regards to that: did I get a deal on the $13 dollar shirt or ripped off on the $20 shirt. Price hopping does not instill loyalty. Finally, there was a shirt of interest, but as I tried to order it , other products showed up. It took a while to read the fine print the shirt was no longer available. So why show it? Bait and switch? Just save time - show what you have...because ...the anime shirt I want...well I found and ordered on RedBubble. Product issues too.",7
Like sizing and the material. The saying on the front of shirt is a little faded,7
I just ordered and received a long sleevetee. The color and quality of the product were exceptional . I love it. Great value for the price (and I got to make some political commentary).,7

The shirt is true to size and good quality. It seemed to take quite a while to receive it. But it was good for the price,7
"I found the website through a Facebook ad. Most Facebook ads I ignore, but thought I would give this one a chance, and I'm glad I did. Great selection of artwork for t-shirts and the final products are good quality too. This is now my go to website for t-shirts. Most items I find are printed in the UK and delivery is quick, occasionally I may find an artwork that can only be printed in the US, but I will pay the international delivery charge and wait a bit longer, as the quality is superb.",7

"The tshirt I ordered came in faster than I expected which was great! The print was a little dull, I thought it would be brighter. I tried to rip the tag off of the bottom of the tshirt (the little white one at the bottom seam) and the shirt ripped a big hole. My hands could easily rip the fabric. I didn't expect that at all. It was my fault for not using scissors to cut the tag in the first place, but the fabric should not have ripped that easily. We are just going to bunch the tshirt to one side and put a rubberband around it like the girls like to do. This shirt is for my daughter's 10th birthday in June.",7
Just as advertized! He loves it & good quality material on T!!!,7

"I received my order for my husbands father day gifts, and the tee's looked great. I washed the shirts in cold water inside out in a laundry bag just to make sure they would look good after washing, wrong they didn't. The prints were already breaking down, I was very upset, but waited a few days before I contacted TeePublic. I sent an email and got very quick response. I was amazed, but happy. The result was 2 new shirts, I will say the results after their washing was great no problems except the Jeremiah bullfrog was not like the original green frog on his first shirt, but he was ok with it. I am now satisfied. I am skeptical about ordering again though, because although the result was good after I contacted the company it is a big hassle to have to go through all that again for a shirt. I would much rather order from a company I really know and get the results I want the first time on a shirt I order, rather than go through all the hassle to get it right the second time.",7
Had to do multiple exchanges. But everyone there was wonderful and very nice.,7

It was great! I am so happy that Teepublic sells shirts that aren't 100 percent cotton. As a tall guy t-shirts usually shrink by with the Tri-blend they fit much better.,7

"Very easy to work with. And when they say order 1-2 sizes bigger, please do so. some of us. needed 2 sizes bigger.",7
Great communication via email. order status notification and shipping via carrier were great.Worth the shipping cost being higher since it arrived much sooner and great tracking notification.Sizes run smaller than US sizes but that is to be expected.,7

"I love Teepublic for the most part. Shirts are top quality. Printing is always excellent. Other products are great too and you can���������t beat their return policy. My only complaint is one that effects me as a buyer and seller; Shipping is ridiculously high especially if you add on a magnet or other product. Case in point I just bought a shirt, a magnet and a sticker for $19 and some change. The shipping was $12! That affects sales for my shop too because potential customers are put off by ",7

"Quick Delivery, excellent service",7
"The selection of t-shirts is great. You can always find the most unique designs for t-shirts for the t-shirt lover in your life. The reason why I give 3 stars is because the color choices for kids t-shirts is very limited compared to those of the color choices for adult t-shirts. I've seen up to 27 color choices for adult t-shirts vs only 10 color choices for kids t-shirts. There's been a few occasions where my children wanted purple, or hot pink, or asphalt shirt color for the t-shirt design they picked but those colors were not available for kids sizes.",7

Fantastic! The shirts were exactly what I wanted and shipped quickly.,7
"Prints were not centered at all on the shirts, colors are not solid and you can see the print lines. Also a few of the shirts were way too short for an XL. Only the Leonardo samurai shirt was acceptable in my opinion.",7
"Enormous selections printed on any color imaginable.If you choose economy shipping as I did, it will take the most amount of days of the range.But overall, I'm satisfied and shirts look great.",7

High quality printing!,7
The tee shorts were well made and size were true. I bought two T-shirts for my grandsons and they were going to arrive late. Late because we were leaving a week before Christmas to another state. This company went over and beyond and shipped us two T-shirts to my daughters address. When asking them any questions they responded immediately. I would definitely order from them again in highly recommend them.,7
Took a little longer to get here than expected but I love it!,7

The service was excellent! They sent me a larger size after the one I ordered was too tight.I didn���������t even have to return it.Ladies sizes are much small,7

"The quality of the actual t-shirt feels good, the design came out nice on both shirts ordered. The shirt has a pretty good fit as well. Pretty much what I was looking for. My only ""complaint"" would be that the t-shirt itself is not tagless. Tags can be a bit annoying and personally I ripped them off.",7
Love how quickly I received my hoodies. My wife amd I are Ween fans. I saw the Deaner hoodie with him making his guitar playing face and knew I needed it. Apparently so did my wife. Don't know who's idea it was to make a hoodie with that picture but that person deserves respect.,7

"This is the coolest t-shirt design I have ever found. Especially given I'm growing a full beard and ride a Fat Boy! However, the print begins to crumble off with the first wash. A had to by a second one to replace the one I bought a month ago because you can barely tell what the first shirt says anymore after just a few times in the wash.I even use a gentle wash cycle but it still starts flaking off the first time you wash it.",7

"The customer service aspect of the company was great. I entered my old address and the package was never forwarded to my new one so they sent me out a new shipment. The shipment arrived today: 1)the sweatshirts smell horribly of vinegar, it is almost unbearable. 2) the logo was supposed to take up the entire middle of the shirt but it is a 2���������/3��������� square.

I absolutely love teepublic I have always ordered from them unique shirts for multiple friends this time I ordered two shirts in a size medium but my friend needed a size large and they no problem set me the largest and told me I did not need to return the mediums I could donate them or give them to someone else and I think that is such good business,7
Excellent products and great service all around!,7
Very Nice sweatshirt!,7
One of the shirts I ordered were way closer in color to the design in person so I reached out to support. They apologized for the inconvenience and are sending me a shirt in another color.on top of that they are letting the printers know to correct any issues for future people who order. Great customer service. Will be buying from them again for sure,7

"Good quality,quick shipping",7
"At first, I must admit I was very disapointed. Despite paying high shipping fees, receiving my order took too much time (but it was around christmas, so I can understand). When I opened my packet, discomfiture... The printing on the shirts was awful, really. I was raging.I changed my mind due to the fast efficient customer service. They apologized and offered me to send immediately replacing shirts. And this time, they provided what I paid for : fast delivery and very good quality.They highly deserve this five stars review and I recommend them warmly.",7
My son loved the two shirts that I got him for Christmas.,7
"LOVE the shirts, purchased 3. One for myself and the others for friends.Nice quality. Shipping took more than a hot moment so think ahead. You won't get this within a few days. Think more like several weeks. I'd still purchase with keeping that in mind.",7
"I ordered three things from TeePublic, and not only did they ship separately, but two of the three gifts didn't arrive.",7
"I love the way the Ghostbuster symbol is on the pillow. Since I know my granddaughter will sleep with it, I'm glad it is not an iron-on or a sewn-on patch.I do, however, feel that the pillow itself could have been sewn a little better. It appears that the pillow cover is a little too small for the insert, so the zipper area is a bit twisted. I see that you offer for things to be fixed, but I need this in two days from now. Otherwise I would have asked that you do so.It's not terrible, I just like things to be a certain way.",7
Well done. The package actually went to a friend in NY. I expert to be hearing from him. Excellent tracking. Better than FedEx.,7
"Customer service alone deserves 5 stars. They were kind enough to make it easier on my pockets when I ended up making two separate orders and they did so promptly. The shirts themselves were quality made. Can���������t expect it to be a $30 shirt for the price you pay for one shirt, but it���������s pretty impressive and looks great. Regardless, they���������re easy to work w",7

"The printing of this shirt didn't come out very solid looking, and it looks maybe a little warped on the left edge. If I had this image I could have made this shirt with my printer at home and ironed it on myself and saved some shipping.",7

The problem with the mask is that because of the pleats you cannot easily read the wording which was the main reason I bought the mask.,7
"Received products quickly, all of them were in perfect condition, no defects. Have not had to use customer service to return anything, so I can't rate that. My only request for improvement is a better search function; adding search string qualifiers, and maybe tags for items, would make it much easier when you're looking for something specific.",7

"My order was in-stock, and shipped the very next day so it arrived in time for the birthday it was for. The shirt looked great and was very much appreciated.",7
"The order, as placed, was delivered. I do wish that perhaps I would have been contacted to inform me that the lettering on a navy heather shirt isindecipherable. The pic on ordering looked to be a blue on navy. In hand, it looks like peeled away lettering. Again, on me for not being more aware. But maybe an opportunity for a step up in service delivery.thx.",7

I love Teepublic as you can search for a variety of unique products that you can't find anywhere else. Most product designs are very creative and very well done.,7
I ordered a sticker from here on December 10th and have not got it yet so I will never order from here again!!!!!!!!!,7
"The customer service was very good. They replaced the T-shirts free of charge plus free shipping because the sizing didn't work for me and one of the designs hadn't been completely printed on the shirt.Now, as for the T-shirts themselves. I'm 6' 165# and all my T-shirts are mediums. Teepublic mediums are a bit form-fitting so I reordered in larges. The problem with going up a size is that the T-shirts were already a bit long in my opinion, so the larges are even longer. Plus, by going up a size they print the designs bigger on the fabric and a bit lower which I do understand the thinking behind it but for me they should have kept the designs the same size and placement the same on the larges as they were on the mediums. Overall, I'd say the T-shirts are just okay, nothing great. At least I got them on sale. I most likely won't be ordering from them again.",7
"Shipping was fast and the purchase process was a breeze however the quality of the shirt used was poor and the imaging of both shirts lacks detail. I purchased both an Allen Iverson and Kobe Bryant shirt, neither image is clear.",7
"The design on this tshirt is awesome!I have never ordered a tshirt online that not only fit well, but that was made with a high quality soft, lightweight material (not thin).Most tshirts are so stiff and heavy!I ordered the dolman style and it fit very well.Length is perfect, not too long!This tshirt is so wearable and the design is so great, you will wear it all the time!",7

So..This was my first time using this site.I wanted a playing card theme shirt. And they had one for 15 bucks..I ordered a men's small..they use DHL for shipping..so my comments..the shirt design is great..the shirt itself is not a soft cotton but a little scratchy. the men's small was narrow on me..but I got it wet and stretched it out to fit..and DHL shipping will make you crazy telling you your shipment will be late..delayed. ..and otherwise..but then show up exactly on time. Would I order from here again..Yes I would..for original designs you can't find elsewhere it's a great site.,7
The t-shirts looked good but the color quality on the hooded sweatshirt I ordered was very poor.,7

Service was quick and efficient,7
Great ideas but products delivered were subpar in printing quality,7
I ordered 4 shirts.Three of them were great.One of the logos was tilted slightly.,7
Ordering shirt was easy. Product and pricing is very good. Spent several years as a P-3 Orion vet.Since introduction of the P-8 it's harder for us retired to find P-3 products.,7
The shirt and design are great!I just miscalculated the size I needed so I should���������ve orde,7
"I love my Buick tee shirt, but the artist should know the Buick depicted on shirt is a Buick Special, not a Roadmaster which was top of the line & a much larger body. I ordered the shirt because it was the Special which my Dad bought when I was 15",7
Love the colors and the detail on all three garments. Love them.,7

"Ordered a 2xl, it is maybe a large.",7
"Great quality shirts and canvas bag! Finally I can truly stay true to my style. Prints stay vivid and bright even after long use and machine washes. Customer service is fast and welcoming. Covid19 makes shipping times longer, but it's totally worth the wait.",7
The photo on the shirt was so dark you couldn't make out anyone's face.,7
Print looks nice. White shirt is nearly see through but I���������ll wear a shirt under it. Overa,7
Received my shirts this week. Exactly what was promised and great quality. I am very pleased.,7
I washed my shirts one time and the pattern has holes in it like it is peeling off in places,7

"Great experience, good quality products.",7
"I ordered 2 shirts and they got here rather quick. The whole process was easy and straightforward, from acquiring my stuff to going to check out and actually checking out was smooth and seamless. I would definitely be buying more things.",7
The company seems awesome but the quality of the product just isn���������t what i expected. My dad bought me a hoodie for Christmas and it was too small but the ink was perfect. I asked for a different size and they got me one with no issues and no exchange. Wonderful! Then the hoodie came in and the ink was so faded. So I asked for an exchange. The hoodie came in again with faded ink so I gave up. I won���������t be wearing any of the h,7
I just love the creativity. The artists on here are awesome and I can get really unique shirts. I just wore one of them to my first Con and the cast commented on it!,7
I've order a few shirts from this company and never been disappointed.,7
This is my go to for unique shirts. Where else can I get shirts that reflect my love of obscure horror movies and support independent artists at the same time? It's great!,7
Cute shirt.Size looks right.The material seem stiff as if too much sizing was put on it.Not sure how it will feel after I wash it. Wish the print colors were just a little bit brighter.,7
"The t-shirts are actually wonderful quality.Shirts are soft and buttery. They fit appropriately.My only complaint was an acetic acid type smell that was emanating from the shirts before I washed them. Smell went away after washing shirts. Not sure if it���������s part of the printing process or not but it was a little off putting. Otherwise the t-shirts are great. Arrived relatively quickly, good price , design matched the picture , etc. I",7
"Masks were nicely designed, but terrible elastic on straps, breaking down already after only 2 weeks",7
"Super fast shipping. Tee fit smaller than I thought it would, and the graphic was a little blurry.",7
"Ordered a tee with the city of ���������Orlando��������� printed across the front. Very simple print, but came out very crooked, not to mention it getting past quality control (if there is any), and being shipped to customer. Contacted management more than once, and absolutely no reply. Very poor business practice, and will not recommend. I���������ll go out of my way to prevent an",7
T-shirt was exactly as shown and good quality. Shipped quickly and I would buy from them again.,7

Beautiful tee shirt and got in time for Easter,7
I love my jacket it's so cute and so warm.,7
"Love the work that you guys do. I ordered a shirt but the print didn't come in the right color, so I reached out and you guys remade it for free, which is super cool. But when I got it, it was the same wrong color as the other shirt I got. I'm not gonna push super hard for this because I'm fine having one more shirt than I planned on, even though it's the wrong color. Great customer service, just wish you guys got the color right.",7
Great quality product! Arrived so quickly and would definitely buy more things of this website,7
"The print on my item was crystal clear. Good fabric and quality of material used on the item is great. I'd order again, definitely. Not at all like other items I've ordered in the past from other company's. Great job!",7
"I ordered an Orange Lantern Corps Face Mask through this website because I liked the simple design. What I received fit the description, more or less, yet the ear loops were different sizes, one of which was considerably smaller, which made it quite uncomfortable to wear. The fabric for the mask itself was also a bit uncomfortable against my face. In hindsight, I should have paid closer attention to the returns policy. I ended up having to cut the loops off and sew different ones on, which definitely isn't my forte, as the alternative was simply throwing it away.",7
Tshirt was perfect and super soft! Great product!,7
T-shirt came in and was even nicer than expected...and it shipped and arrived very quickly!,7
Honorable and great material timely sted fast delivery! Customer service department is cordial and responses quite quickly. Cool spot to order from.,7
"I love the quality, sizes, and selection of your hoodies. However, I only gave you ���������������������������'s because you decided to no longer print the great message I previously had ordered, and inte""I Survived College Without Becoming a Social Justice Warrior"". Now, TeePublic has altered the message that just reads, and promotes, ""Social Justice"". Does TeePublic no longer tolerate opposing political points of view? Not all your customers are pro-socialism, you know???",7
"Love our RBG shirts!The designs are great, and the tees fit nicely!",7
"Fast shipping, good price, nice quality.",7
One shirt was sized appropriately but the tank top was way to big according to your sizing chart,7
Kudos to the Artist�������,7
I loved the price and how fast it was shipped to my home,7
"I ordered a T-shirt, medium size. When I got it , size did not fit. So I sent an email, to the contact us email address and explained them and mentioned that i wanted an exchange of the T-shirt , with a bigger size and was willing to pay for the shipping cost.To my pleasant surprise, they sent me a Large size T-Shirt, free of cost and told me to keepmedium one too.That is called, customer satisfaction.",7
"Good shirt quality (I got the tri-blend) The art graphic is good looking, but could be more vibrant. Make those colors pop.",7
Did not receive tank top in time for the concert even though I paid for expedited shipping.Tank top is very poor quality.Will never order from this company again.,7
"Three different shipments of the same shirts, and can't get the size right? All shirts labeled XL are either child-sized or come down to your knees. But they are labeled exactly the same, even come in the same package. The size L shirts are designed fit small children. I think they haven't a clue. Never buy from them again.",7
The t-shirts are super awesome!!Reasonable prices. Shipping is fast and feels good to support independent artists!!,7

"I expected the shirt to have sequins/glitter ...not a picture of that, and I don���������t have enough time to get a replacement for my birthday! I am furious, I feel cheated, you are fraud if people and I will post this comment wherever I can to make sure it doesn����",7
I have ordered more than a dozen t-shirts. Always very happy with the print and the t-shirt quality. These last two t-shirts I noticed the fabric is different. Read the label sure enough a different manufacturer. The colour is not as black and the fabric and stitching seems thinner and cheaper.Not as high in quality as the previous ones.,7
"Great prices on your long sleeve t-shirts, nice and thick material . . . fast delivery easy to track!! Will not hesitate to order again from TeePublic!!",7
I ordered a 3x planning on the shirt fitting loose.They were both too tight.These are obviously cut small.,7

so many of my fellow team members love the designs and ask me where i got them. I know for a fact 1 person ordered them.,7
We ordered shirts for a family birthday party and each one was perfect! Great color and great quality!!,7
Love the shirts!!! They look amazing.,7
They were great designs and lots of fun! The tshirts had a weird smell when we took them out of the package though,7
Mask is unusable. Cute design but at least try to make it functional,7
"The shirts I ordered were delivered exactly as pictured and I love them. However, the shipping price and experience were not consistent... I paid ten dollars for two shirts, and waited nearly three weeks for that price. Not a wonderful experience. Great shirts, terrible shipping experience.",7
"The T-shirt screening seemed to be poorly done, and the T-shirt material was cheap and flimsy.",7

"I was looking for a Kate bush design on Teepublic, and I didn't find one to my liking, so I decided to make my own. I created the Kate Bush design and bought the shirt. I came back a couple hours later to review the design, and noticed the design had a few mistakes I overlooked. I then made a clean edit and was able to re uploadthe illustration and then talk to Teepublic about replacing the design I had just ordered earlier with the new edit. Support was very kind and understood my issue. The design was delivered quickly and the print was incredible. I was very happy to see that customers would be getting a pretty accurate 1 to 1 t-shirt if they decide to buy my Kate Bush design in the future.",7
I ordered a black shirt. Looks dingy and smaller than normal,7
The shirts are good quality but more than 2 sizes too small. I'm hopping they fit. I love the look.,7
The shipment to Australia was quick and we love the t-shirt design.I would recommend purchasing from this company.,7
"TeePublic���������s website does not factor in customs charges in final price, appeared to be a good deal but was hit with a customs charge after delivery that alone cost way more than I originally paid for the item itself. Delivery incredibly slow (55 days!) and expensive, and no mail updates after the item was despatched from US mailing facility. Finally when the items arrived (after paying additional charges) the prints on both shirts were stuck together as they weren���������t individually wrapped, I was worried the designs I had chosen would peel off instantly. I���������m not convinced either will survive a wash when I give them away as a g",7

Super quick shipping. Love the product.,7
The shirt was exactly as it was shown in the picture! Quick shipping!,7
"Terrible experience with this company and will never order again. The shipping time was stated to be 10-20 business days, yet it was way longer than that before my item was delivered and the company did nothing.

The process of ordering these shirts was such a simple process. We waited a super understandable amount of time for them to print and ship. We were so excited when they arrived. We would order from them again. We love our Ts!!,7

"Good quality, design clots are sharp.",7
"All 3 shirts were great, the material is soft and the shirts were true to size. I'll definitely buy again.",7
"Ordered 3 shirts, the quality of the shirt seems good at first but the quality of the prints could be better, I expected little bit more there. For the discounted price ok, I wouldn't pay the regular price though.",7
Received my order but was not the shirt IOrdered. Reached out through email and have had no reply. Not very satisfied with the service.,7
One of the shirts I got started to peel off with the first washing have not even been worn did not put in the dryer hung it up to dry tried to send in to customer service but could not find how to send picture,7
Fast delivery. My shirt is soft and comfortable.,7
Better than expected quality and good customer service that helped resolve a customs fee issue to my satisfaction.,7
The sizes on the lightweight hoodies run small. I bought two as a gift and realized that I need to exchange them. The exchange process was super quick and easy. They helped me find the size chart and get me the size I needed. Everyone had quick responses and very helpful.,7

Excellent customer service! Quick service!,7
Quality products. Timely shipping.,7
Everything came as advertised and on time! Zero issues.,7
Excellent customer service and a quality product.,7
"Great customer service. Order was delayed at a shipping hub, they sent another one anyway. Later both arrived for no extra charge. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the actual product I ordered could've used an expert eye. The print and fabric color were too similar so the sweater looks blank. A warning notice or email from a graphic designer would've been nice but my fault not theirs",7
My Camaro t-shirt turned out great!The cotton feel of it was softer thanI expected.,7
"Received my cleanly printed tee shirt in a most timely fashion.The color and design are precisely as advertised so I was extremely pleased with the product and the entire transaction.The only minor improvement I can think of is if I could have received an instant email confirmation at the time of ordering like the bigger companies do, otherwise everything was perfect ... to a tee!",7
"So many options and I found exactly what I needed.The package came to the house quickly and one item was perfect but the other was too small.I noticed that they would fix it for free, I submitted a replacement online, I received an email and now I'm waiting for that.Great service, very helpful.I'm so glad to have found tee public.Great company.",7
Ordered items for Christmas gifts were wrong size and y���������all graciously sent the right size that we needed. Great ,7
The only issue I have with your company is the shipping charge! 7$ to ship a face mask is too much. $2 is more realistic,7
"This was my first purchase of a TeePublic T-shirt, so I didn't know what to expect. I was very impressed with the quality of the shirt...the material, the design, the size...all perfect. It's a Christmas present for my husband. He'll open it tonight on Christmas Eve, and he's going to love it!",7
I really love how teepublic supports artists and the materials were soft and very comfortable!,7
Love the designs. Unfortunately the placement of them on the masks make them unreadable. No point of having having a quote on a mask if it's in the creases or bunched in the corner.,7
"The shirts I ordered were great, and arrived in great time!",7
"Excellent shirt and design -- had REALLY STRONG sweet scented fabric softener (or processing chemical) that required 2 washes to remove.Otherwise, I'm EXTREMELY PLEASED with the voltron t-shirt purchase!nate",7

Your use of the USPS for shipping is your only rub. They don't care a bit about their service and you never know when your order will arrive. Their tracking system is useless.,7

Sizing is accurate. Good quality material. Good service.,7
I���������m satisfied enough with the design but I wasn���������t expecting the white transfer residue to be all around the outside of the image. I think this image should be applied only to lighter colored shirts so it���������s not so obvious.8-10-19 Update- TeePublic did an outstanding job goi,7

The tee shirt I ordered was a soft comfortable material with vivid colors. My son loves it. It was the size I expected too.,7
I buy a shirt from TeePublic every year for my brother. He's never been disappointed. Great quality shirts!,7

"Love the hoodies! One of them didn't show up in the original package but the amazing customer service team fixed the situation quickly and I just received the 3d sweatshirt yesterday. Love the designs! My only problem is the hoodie I got for myself (3XL) is unexpectedly small in the lower half of the sweathirt, which I makes for an interesting fit. Wearing it unzipped is totally fine, which i how I generally wear my hoodies.",7
"Cool design and quality t shirts, but the time was clearly not taken to properly align the screen printing job, because all three shirts have logos that are pretty far off center, and one is especially crooked. The sad part is that this seems to be the norm, these days, so it���������s a bummer to see yet another t shirt maker adhere to a lower standard than they should. The printing part is like one third of the entire project, and no one seems to care whether it�����",7
"My purchase was lost and in an attempt to compensate me for the inconvenience, I was offered a 35% discount on an additional purchase.This seemed disingenuous as it was the same discount that had been offered in multiple marketing emails I'd been receiving since my original purchase.",7

"It was horrible. I ordered one thing as a gift for a friend and I got it way off schedule. Printing took over six days to complete, even though they said that at most it would take three. You would think that after spending so much time at the printers that the design would come out good... Nope It looks like a kinder-gardener drew it on with washable markers. I was going to send a photo to their support workers but no camera is able to fully capture the horrific state it's in, this is truly frustrating!I'm really disappointed and will probably never order from here again. I don't recommend anyone else does either.",7
My shirt got here fast. Very satisfied with it. I will be ordering more from them.,7
Customer service and delivery on my two orders was great. The light blue writing on the dark blue onesie is a little hard to see. I wish that slogan was written in a yellow or some other color that would show up better on a dark blue background.,7

The quality of the print on the Bebop Nasa shirt is not what is shown in the image; the print is much more faded and even a little blurry.Also the shirts were too small & the website is not upfront about their return policy.,7
"I was expecting the graphic on the bag to be shiny, not flat. Think rhinestones versus screen print.",7
When I ordered this product I needed them right away I had the offer to add extra money to what I thought was to have my shipment sent to me in 3 to 5 days. I stead I was not billed the extra money and the shipment never came until after the weekend was over that I needed them for.,7

"One of the colors showed up different, and due to the shirt color you can't see two of the words.",7

I have ordered several shirts for here. Love the designs and all of the shirts have been just like what's on the site. Shipping was fast and the shirts are worth the price. Will definitely continue to purchase from them.,7
I was delivered the wrong color shirt and contacted the site about this over a week ago and I have still not got a reply. However they are junking my email up. So they can pester you but not help you.,7

Cool stuff. Very plenty niceSasddfgffhhjjkkkkkkk,7
"None of the t-shirts fit, which is fine, because I was told they would all be replaced, but according to what has been shipped as replacements, everything is still wrong. I requested that all the women's shirts be replaced with a men's size medium, because the medium shirt I ordered was the only one that fit my wife. I also requested that the cranberries shirt come in light blue but it looks like they sent black. I requested that the Evanescence shirt (which I was told was out of stock) be replaced with a similar Evanescence shirt in the same color (brown) but it looks like what has been sent is in light blue. It also appears that the Dream Theater shirt has been replaced by a completely different shirt, not the men's large which I requested ������������",7

"I ordered female tri-blend T-shirt from TeePublic. I was very excited to find out that they print my design on Tri-blend shirts. The first order I received was a male shirt (male size S). The second replacement they sent me was the same thing... I checked the measurements and size chart on their web site and a customer rep confirmed that indeed what I received was a male shirt. Then they sent me another replacement. Now this time, it was a female shirt but labeled as ""L"" and it fits me like L. What I ordered was a female ""S"" shirt... so yet again I contacted them... they insisted that the shirt I got was size small, but MISLABELED, despite the photos I included in my emails. Now I don't know how many emails I've dealt with as different people keep asking me sending photos over and over, I'm still waiting for a full refund. Wasted so much time... And they cannot confirm why this is happening. I have no confidence ordering a tri-blend t-shirt in the future with them at all as well as in their customer service and production management.Update: I did receive a full refund FINALLY, which I'm thankful for. However, no follow-up Email on the refund or explanation to why/how these errors happen so often.",7
Love the T-shirt true to size too,7
Too small! The v-neck seems to be junior sizes.,7
Great Customer service got a easy exchange for a different size,7

Graphics are the same as shown on the site. The tri-blend feels and fits great. This shirt is definitely worth the money I paid for it.,7
Quality and unique shirts at a reasonable price!,7
Shirts received are of poor quality. You can see through them. The letters were already faded when I took it out of the package.,7
The product was fine. The shirt is great. It seems like UPS mail innovations is a very slow way to shipping anything..This took way longer to arrive to my house than most other shipping,7

They really got their act together!Fast delivery of a spectacular product. Shirts fade after washing (a lot... like 50-75) which i love because it doesn't peel off it gives more of a vintage feel and makes the shirts look even better!! We love teepublic! Now add dresses please!,7
I got my shirt with a week and a half of ordering! Great service & good quality,7
Paid for premium and you can read the newspaper through the shirt. Cheap and will not do business again. Contacted and no response as well. Do not waste your time or money.,7
I waited for a long time to get it and as soon as I noticed that even after Christmas It still hasn't arrived. I reached out the company and they immediately replaced it NO questions asked.MY gift went over very well.He even said this is my favorite t-shirt.,7

"The fans of Irish Folk Music are smitten with TeePublic's offerings of merchandise featuring the group--The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. One of the Facebook Groups which celebrates CB & BM has a post featuring the CB&TM merchandise which caused me to go to the TeePublic website and buy a tee shirt, a coffee mug, a travel mug and a face mask.IF TeePublic had any idea about just how many CB &TM fans are still out there (hint more than 2 million), TeePublic would bring other similar merchandise to their website and we would buy it.Mind you, other licensed photos would be appreciated.I bought a t shirt, a mug, a travel mug and a face mask.TeePublic is offeringthese items and we, the loyal fans of CB&TM want them.Plain and simple.It is worth mentioning too that TeePublic has a very large selection of tee shirt sizes for men and women.That does not happen too often.",7

"Horrible. Placed a $100 order in time for ""guaranteed"" Christmas delivery. As of today, Monday, January 9th, 2023, writing this review and I STILL do not have any of the items from my purchase, contained a number of Christmas gifts for my family. Teepublic did eventually refund the shipping charges, but it is of little consolation given the purchase is now nearly a month overdue. I received only 2 email updates re: the status of my order and only 1 of those hinted at any potential delay suggesting it might not arrive on time as promised (any other updates I received had to be prompted by my sending emails to Teepublic demanding some (any) information about my order).Teepublic needs to be completely upfront, transparent and truthful about it's order processing and shipping estimates (or do away with the guessing all together) and stop luring customers into a false sense of assurance that their purchase will arrive ""on time"". For these reasons, I cannot recommended this company and would advise anyone considering shopping with them to think twice. Learn from my mistake. Never again for me.",7

"I���������m an artist and a customer of your items, in the past I���������ve had zero issues with you and I���������ve purchased so many items from you.

"Many products are expensively priced, a few of which are outrageously so. Additionally, shipping seemed much more expensive than it needed to be. All of this would be fine, however, if Teepublic made it very clear to the consumer how much of the money ends up going to the independent artists. Teepublic makes a VERY big deal out of how each purchase, ���������supports an indie artist,��������� so I found it very odd how they do not clearly disclose to what degree the artists receive compensation.

I ordered 2 shirts based on your sizing chart and they were too small. I contactedTeePublic and they are replacing the shirts with the proper sized ones. Very good customer service.,7
The problem with these tee shirts are that they are so cool I can't stop buying more and more of them.,7
"I am very satisfied with my order from TeePublic, I had ordered a medium sized tank top from them and it didn't take long for it to arrive and when it did arrive, the package was secure and the material and look of the shirt was great.",7

"Poor shipping... After I ordered and waited almost 6 weeks, still no order to an APO address. Your customer service then informed me they are having trouble with APO orders and needed a civilian address to re-ship the order or I can cancel the order. An APO address is a military address serviced by the US Postal Service just like having a stateside address.I asked to cancel my order since I don���������t a civilian address. Don���������t know if that happened, but I got the order yesterday. Looking at the package it seems you used DHL, which I understand just sends it to USPS and then they do the rest. This adds a couple of weeks, at least, to the process. The poor customer service is the cause of my rating, my t-shirt is very nice. Not sure I���������ll order anymore until your customer service reaches ou",7

"TeePublic has a lot of great, vast variety of selections to choose from. What drew me to their online outlet was variety, considerably reasonable prices and valid, great deals when they have their product markdowns and sales! I shop for mostly Borderlands and some of the pop culture things from 90s and early 2000s. Never before my purchase at TeePublic have I managed to come across a worthwhile purchase of something from the movie The Fifth Element, and they had some vibrant colors and strong visual screen prints!",7
"I like the products, and the site is easy to use, but maybe free shipping for orders over a certain amount would be cool.",7

Shirt came on time and is amazing!!! I love itso much!!,7
"I ordered two t-shirts and received both of them almost immediately. I am really quite pleased with them but I would suggest that people order at least one size larger than their normal size in t-shirts. If the two I received shrink, they'll be far too tight over the bust for me to wear.",7

The shirts are a great quality. I need 4x tshirst and the price is reasonable,7

"Very overpriced t-shirts (not 100% cotton!)I've paid over $30 for a regular t-shirt and teepublic.com also charging for shipping on top of thee price (~$8). And t-shirt is not even 100% cotton! 50% polyester, 25% rayon , 25% cotton.Total out of pocket price around $40.Next time will order on Ali.Don't recommend teepublic.com to friends and family members.",7

Excellent t-shirts at a great price. Need more tigger shirts and cookie monster,7
"The customer service was good but my first shirt wasn't sent out or something. Had to call to get a replacement. Was mad about that considering it was a Christmas present for my wife, so customer service good but ordering sucks, and the shirt was supposed to be in black, came in charcoal grey, thankfully my wife dealt with it and I didn't have to go through calling or emailing a third time",7
"The quality seems good, and the designs look great.My only issue is the shirts are too long.They have the proper fit everywhere and then the length of a girls pajama shirt.",7
"I recently opened shop on TeePublic and had never ordered from them before, so I took advantage of a sale and ordered two of my designs for me and my other haf.They look EXACTLY like they should, are super soft, and I can't wait for laundry day (there's a chemical smell from the printing) so I can finally wear it out in public!",7

Hi I really love the shirts when they arrive. But my only issue with your shirts is that because each shirt size is not by the same company. Some of the shirts that are larges o fit differently .because I had threelarge shirts fromthree different shirt company the Nextel shirts and that large fits smaller than the large from the Gilden shirts.I think it will be a point to make sure that all of the shoots from the same company that won���������t make it better for your consumers. Just to assure her that those they have larges they offered the same way instead of someone having a large from a different company and either to,7

"The quality of my items was fine; the button and hoody were well made. I'd suggest using white instead of gold lettering on the button -- difficult to read.As for the hoody, the color and image were just what I wanted.Sizing, however, is way off (I normally wear a L or XL depending on cut, but the fit is more like a very tight large).The images on the site showing different sized models really weren't that helpful for determining size.The hoody is not useable for me.Not quite sure what I'll do with it.",7

"The shirts I ordered were wonderful, and I'm sure will be well-received come Christmastime.My only criticism would be that had I known ahead of time that the packaging bag is emblazoned with lots of company logos, I would have made arrangements to ship somewhere other than home.Now everyone knows that they're getting the shirts they'd expressed interest in on your website!Ruined holiday surprise!",7

"Excellent customer service, had an issue and they took care of it immediately.Great job guys.",7
"Very happy overall, except one issue. Size fits, paid for the softer fabric, shipping timeline was good too.The issue is, during the pressing of the design, it looks as though it was left a little too long being pressed, or the machine was too hot, which resulted in a thin line at the bottom which was burned into the fabric. It has been washed, yet it still remains.Perhaps a slight misstep during the process or post quality check was missed. I'll be sending an image and inquiring about resolution. It's still wearable, but sadly, after paying 30 bucks, it is flawed.I am pleased otherwise. Definitely not something to swear about, and nothing perhaps a credit couldn't fix.Thanks guys.",7
Love this website and the customer service is awesome. Had an issue with the sizes and they immediately worked to fix it. We definitely need to order a size larger than what we think. We will order more from Tee Public.,7

all went well and I like the product. no issues with shipping..,7
"Extremely disappointing. I have put in 2 different orders, 1 with only 2 shirts and the other order several. I should have waited for the first order to come in before ordering the 2nd. Couple of shirts the prints are not centred or offset. I have one shirt the print is on the back of the shirt not the front like all the others advertised.You can't contact anyone to help you.Nothing you can do. Do not order from this site. Just a WARNING. You will be as pissed as I am.As you see the response below to go to the website they posted for me to go to...all it does is put you back to the homepage.It's to much hassle for them to so called, ""MAKE IT RIGHT"" comment.Your better off going to someone else to get your shirts done.",7

Great customer service.Shirts do run Small.But great quality.,7
"You guys always do great with responding to customer service. I had an issue with the last shirt I had bought, and while sending me a better quality print on the shirt (from the dealer) would have been a better option than receiving a new shirt with the same crap quality print, still better than nothing.Kind of the same issue here -- the website itself is great and so are you guys, I just have another issue with a poor quality shirt; especially from what is supposed to be a bigger brand. Either the vendor itself is an impostor, or the quality was never that good to begin with. I guess I'll find out.",7
Fabulous timing!,7

Why was my order returned? I got a tracking number and it said my order was returned to sender without explanation,7
"I purchased an orange ""������ Totally Irrational"" tee shirt because ""PI"" are my initials and the sentiment matches my own outlook!Overall quality of the item is good, but the printing seemed a little ""thin"", making it look worn already. I'm guessing that look may have been the intention of the creator, but, given the ""message"", it didn't seem to express that boldness as well as it might have had the printing been more opaque. I did see some other items on the website that I'm considering.",7

"The designs are clever and beautiful. However, the actual finished product has dull coloring and the sizes are very inconsistent. The xs youth is smaller than 3t toddler shirt. The adult medium was more like a youth XL, whereas the adult large was right on point. I'm sad that two of my shirts won't fit my son's.",7

"T-shirts are super cute, arrived timely and are of good quality.",7

I love the design but ordered a RED short for sale and was sent a PINK shirt. I paid $13.99 for priority to get it before Christmas. Now I sit here with a shirt that I cannot use and paid double the price to receive it on time.,7
I ordered this as a last minute Christmas gift for my granddaughter and was worried that it might not makeit on time. The whole process went smoothly and it arrived in less than a week from order date.,7

The logos on the shirts were very good but the shirts are way too small.I ordered a womens 2xl and it was more like a medium large.Men���������s medium was on the small size as well.You have a great variety of artwork for the shirts but it would be great to have the shirts true ,7
"Great material, fun design",7
Delivery early. Loved by 7 yr old. Class really liked it too. Fits with room to grow. But not too big. Colors went well together. He is crazy about tripods.,7
I have made purchases from TeePublic quite a few times and they are always spot on re: customer service and final product.their mission of helping independent artists and business people is a bonus.,7
"This was one of the best companies to work with. The website which showed all of the products was well done. It was easy and fast to order and I received my shirt right away. The best part for my shirt was that it showed the fighter jet I worked on, the ship I was attached to and my world famous VF-84 patch. The detail was great.",7
I love the designs. Costner service is excellent.,7
Good deal fast shipping,7
"I purchased some shirts for gifts. I was notifyed that they had been delivered, but sadly not to me.I contacted the companyand told them they had Not been delivered and they sent me another order to replace my purchase.They truly stand behind their product and care about customer service. That is why I gave them a 5 star review !!",7
Love the design! Exactly what I was looking for! Even better that it's printed on my favorite Vneck Bella canvas shirt!!,7
"The shirt itself fits well and is very soft fabric.The colors in the print are as brilliant as the original poster, and the images are clear.It really contrasts the Carnival of Souls movie, which is in black and white; drab, dark, and eerie!",7
I was a little nervous with this order because I didn't know anything about your company.But I really wanted these t-shirts.They are perfect!!I am so pleased.I can't wait to see the reaction when they open their gift!!Thank you!!,7
The shirts look great. My only issues is they are not true to size and run very very small. My Mom weighs 101 pounds and the XL is tight on her. I washed them and then stretched and line dried them to try and get a bit more room in the shirts. Luckily these are for Thanksgiving Day only and I will put them up and make pillows out of them after this so it only has to fit for 1 day.,7
"Wonderful products with lots of options and high-quality materials, even for their ���������base��������� level t-shirts. I especially appreciate the visual guidelines for their ",7

Everything was simple.Website is user friendly and the item purchased was great quality.,7
Love the shirt,7
"Loved the mask graphic design and fabric. However, without the nose wire, the masks slipped down constantly, requiring adjustment by hand. In addition, ear loops were a tad too large and not adjustable (which I knew to be the case before purchasing. This problem may have been mitigated if the mask had the nose wire to hold it in place more securely.",7
"I ordered the lovely Laszlo and Nadja red hoodie.The construction, and the material are top notch.I ordered a size that turned out to be too large.I contacted TeePublic, and they sent me a smaller size, and were so kind, professional, and QUICK!I will only order from this stellar company from here on out.",7
"It is just not the greatest quality of shirt. Very thin, kinda short, and the silk-screening was not very tight and exact on the edges. I like it but was hoping for a bit more quality.",7
Shirt is great qualityand not cheaply made. Design is well printed on the shirt and is a great image.,7
The artwork is amazing and so cool. Star Wars meets Van Gogh! It's a gift for my husband and I know he will love it. The image quality is perfect and the right thickness of color. Looks great on the black t-shirt.,7
Love my shirt! The quality of the design is great my only remark is that the shirt itself is a little bit of a thinner material so it may not be as durable in the long run. Other than that I�������,7

Sewing of mask hid Math pun punchline and there was a weird white stripe in black fabric. Tried contacting customer service and they are so behind that it���������s been nearly a week and I still haven���������t heard from them. (Which doesn���������t speak well to o,7

"T-shirt���������s look good, maybe the colours aren���������t quit",7
Customer service was the best! The custom sweatshirt that I ordered for my grandson was too small and Tee Public sent a brand new better fit replacement very quickly and I was told to keep the original or donate it....my other grandson was happy to have a matching sweatshirt like his cousin! Highly recommend this awesome company,7
"Totally satisfied with my purchase. I ordered at the height of the X-Mas chaos, and my shirts were still processed and shipped quickly.",7
Excellent service and received exactly what I ordered. VERY HAPPY!!,7
"I love this website! They say you can find absolutely anything you're possibly looking for, and it's actually pretty much true! I even searched for Blake's 7 (late 70s sci-fi show in UK) design for my brother, and there were several; so even if you're after something niche, you can likely find it here. There's a range of t-shirt styles/materials (classic tee, tri-blend, etc)...I find the fit is always great (I always choose tri-blend), and far more consistent than many more expensive brands. I've probably bought around ten t-shirts from here so far in the last year, and it's pretty much my go-to now. The shirts generally arrive within a week or so, which I consider to be fine, given the desigjn/production process. On top of all that, if you have any problems they promise to fix it for free (I've never had any problems so far!) I absolutely recommend TeePublic!",7
I ordered a shirt in a medium but received an extra small. I tried requesting an exchange but never got a response,7

I do wish shipping would be faster especially if you are paying for it. Otherwise, I was very happy with my purchase. My daughter loved her gift, late or not.",7
Have always had great luck with teepublic!Sales are fantastic & the amount of choices is insane.,7
great customer service and products were as advertised,7
Love the artwork on the t-shirt and customer service fixed a problem for me free of charge!!,7
"Love the designs and variety on shirt colors/styles, as well as detailed modeling of the shirt sizes. Only thing is that there's an extremely heavy glue smell but that fades eventually",7
"First shirt was wrecked by the adhesive on the envelope, but it was rectified immediately.",7
I got 3 shirts for my Mom.She absolutely loves the designs and feel of the shirts. Will be ordering more soon.,7
It had a strong smell of vinegar when I got it so don't expect to wear it right out of the bag. The smell went away completely after washing. The shirt looks great and the sizing was accurate.,7

"Excellent customservice!! Unbelievable!! Thank you, guys!!Cool T-shirt ideas, great material (soft) and print!!I like the idea of supporting the artists!Just overall excellent!! :)I'm gonna send a new order right away ;)",7
"The shirt arrived quickly and I was happy with the quality out of the package. Although after one wash the screen print is already cracking and peeling. I love Teepublic's designs and supporting independent artists, but until their printing quality improves, I can't see myself buying from them again.",7
The t-shirts I ordered were a good quality and the screens on them were perfect.,7
I really liked how the t-shirts and how fast I got them.,7

"Great designs, fast shipping",7
"The fit is a little small but ok.The color is absolutely terrible!

"When I had a problem and contacted Tee Public online about it, I received a reply very quickly. Unfortunately the person who replied suggested a solution that made it very clear this person had not read through my complaint. I replied something to that effect. Could that 1st reply have been a bot?Shortly after that, a different person responded to me and told me they were resolving the problem; I was very happy with their resolution.I also am a big fan of any organization that puts artists and their work front and center. And Tee Public does that.",7
Relatively quick shipping. Shirts are of decent quality. Sizing on shirts runs a lil small and since it's 100% cotton they shrink. Buy 1 size larger than you would normally get.,7
"Love the design, and material",7
Fit is small.,7

"The shirt I ordered is fine. It's nothing special in terms of quality and the print on it is the one I wanted. The problem I had was when my order took 15 days (instead of 7 to 12) to get here and customer service couldn't give me any information. I ended up in an endless loop of the tracking number not working and responses to emails telling me that it would be here ""soon.""",7
Prints are incredible,7
I tried to email 4 times no response ever. It said 24 hours. I wanted to cancel order and I ended up getting a 35.00 sweatshirt I did not want.,7

So happy with all of them.I only bought 4 masks....wish I had found your site first but they are so cute and well done.I used them as stocking stuffers! The guys got a kick out of them.,7

Haven't had a problem with TeePublic yet. Even better now they ship out of Cabada,7
Product was exceptional high quality and very amazingly quick shipping & delivery service,7
The shirts are good quality and I didn't experience any shrinkage after washing.,7
"As other customers mentioned, the T-shirts are a bit thin, even for Premium and Tri-blend, but I don't mind it if they last (time will tell).The shirts are soft, and sized well.There are thousands of designs to choose from, so I wish search was better.The design previews are way too sharp, because the image cannot be printed with this high detail, so the product looks different than the preview.But I like the look of the actual product--the image looks like it belongs on the T-shirt, whereas the preview looks like a crisp photo pasted to a shirt.Anyway, good T-shirts overall, I think this is my go-to source for T-shirts now.Of course, time will tell how they hold up.",7
Great love it will be ordering Moe items from you.,7
Love the t-shirts.,7

Great fast customer service. Can't wait to order more.,7
I ordered a long sleeve tee.It was received in a reasonable time.The product was as advertised and is good quality for the price. This was not the first time we've ordered something from Tee Public.They have a wide variety of choices.The hardest part is going thru all the selection options to make a choice!,7
Good quality artwork and it looks great framed!,7
i loved the customer service!! The shirt sizes are are way to small.The white color on snoopy is a light pink should be white.,7
I love my shirt I wish you guys would remake more teammates in to saiyans like Klay Thompson and Draymond Green please do that if you do let me be the first one to get one please,7
I like soft shirts that get to my doorstep on time.,7
The shirt arrived on time and in one piece.,7
"The service was very quick. When the shirt size did not work out, and exchange was done seamlessly, making me feel like a valued customer.",7
"I wish there would have been an option for a 4xl TALL.. I love this shirt already, but feel like a couple of washes it will be to short. I played college football and have wide shoulders. This tends to make shirts even shorter than normal.. thank you",7
T shirt designs out beautifully and they fit perfectly.,7
T-shirt had a flaw.They sent me a replacement free of charge.��������,7
Everything about my experience was professional and organized down to the packaging of the sweatshirt I purchased. Awesome company to work with and order from. Glad to see independent artists getting support and making a living. I would definitely order from TeePublic again.,7
"I'm impressed with the quality of the shirts. Better than Walmart's cheap tees. I purchased several shirts from one artist because I love her colorful art. DianesTees.com Diane has very unique designs and lots of colorful designs. I like bright colors on my t-shirts. A lot of her colorful designs really stand out. I'll be buying from this artist again, I already saved her website for the near future.",7
"Excellent service, I ordered shirts for Christmas and they came in the wrong size,I contacted them and they sent out shirts to replace them and ask me to donate the shirts of the wrong size,which I gave to the small girls next door",7

Love the shirt for my toddler super good quality,7
"Great shirts. Awesome designs, fits perfectly.",7
"I love love love my stevie poster but, the item took over two months to arrive and customer service was slow and unhelpful.",7
"Designs are great. Colors, fabrics, and styles are also great. Prices are a bit high for T-shirts. It���������s definitely worthwhile when they���������re on sale ($20 and up for regular price). Shipping fees are also high for purchasing a few shirts ($6.99 for 1-4 shirts; $12.99 for more than four shirts) and it still takes too long to arrive. If you���������re paying high prices for delivering a T-shirt at least get it here quickly. T-shirts arrive",7
The product is much nicer than I imagined. Good quality tshirt. VERY PLEASED,7
"Love the design on my Pink Floyd Tee,,,the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the material is very thin and flimsy...not thinking it is going to last very long...we will see.",7
Unique designs and quality materials make these t-shirts you can be proud to wear.,7
The T-shirt���������s should be of better quality for the price. The sizes run WAY SMALL. Because they are so thin and so small we are not able to wear them. $77. Including delivery and they are still sitting in their delivery bag. No returns because they are �����,7

Great experience... Would buy from here again,7
I ordered 2 xl .. it came as maybe a smaller xl .. I���������m not going to order anything from them ever again .. I���������ve bought 2xl from several other places and they have been true to size .. considering the price and the amount of time it to,7

Love it! Always hard to find stuff I like in sizes I need LOL!,7
"This graphic tee connoisseur is thrilled with her order. Good quality tees, good quality prints. Will definitely be ordering from Tee Public again.",7
I like to support the artist...but honestly the printing on both of my shirts were poor quality and the designs were faded.,7

This is a great company. I ordered a shirt in large. The shirt was fantastic but the large seemed a little small. I emailed to exchange it for a larger size. They could not have been more helpful and understanding. The customer service is as great as the shirt I ordered. I highly recommend them!!,7
Great products & fantastic service! Will definitely buy again.,7
"The quality of the images were amazing. The shirts are extremely comfortable also. I ordered mediums, which I found to be a bit snug on me unfortunately, but non the less I'll order again from them!",7
"Everything would be good for the price if the material was good quality, not thick it is thin",7
"The t-shirt was a perfect fit! But even more importantly, the art is awesome and fits very nicely on the front of the t-shirt! I chose the better quality t-shirt, and it was a good decision as the fabric is very comfortable and soft. On a side note, the shipping was fast, but that, to be honest, is of little concern to me.",7
Great product and shipped fast. Ordered a few onesies for my kid. He now looks even more perfect!,7
"Shirts were made and shipped in a timely fashion.Arrived in one bag, not separated by anything.The white shirt had multiple stains and/or dirt no related to the design or color pallet unless it was color transfer from the other shirt ordered.Luckily they came out in washing.I���������m not excited to place another order anytime soon or recommend to ",7
"After 1-2 years I again ordered 5 t-shirts from here. Now they did not come from the US but somewhere near. Sender unknown. Box was a box for bottles. The t-shirts had been pressed into the box. Was not nice. Print is ok, a little bit to deep. Colors are a little fresher than the T-Shirt before. But as there is no Premium T-Shirt possible to order any more I���������am not really happy. Simple Guldan Shirts do not match the cool prints.I tried to contact the manufacturer, bit I did not know him. Also the market place is not really contactable. Or I do not find how. It is a pitty. I love the designs and brought many people to buy the shirts. But I will try obce the heavy shirt now and if this is also not good (I mean there isn���������t any grey for the heavy shirt, really?!)",7
"Excellent service, very professional,highly recommended!",7
I ordered a large and it was a little snug but I love it so much there's no way I'm sending it back!,7
"I am tired of being led on a wild goose chase. I ordered two shirts and a mug on August 2, and the mug is the only item I received so far. Got E-mail yesterday (August 7 -Sunday, no less, when the post office isn't open anyway) saying shirts had arrived but they were nowhere to be seen on the porch when I went to retrieve them. A previous e-mail I received at the end of last week said shirts were mailed separately and would be arriving today, August 8. No one's telling me the truth about where that portion of my order is or when I will get it. I received the mug I ordered late last week.I doubt I will be ordering from TeePublic again if this situation can't be resolved. I'm now out $60 for merchandise I can't track anymore.",7
Good quality. Shirts look just like what they described and in the picture. Also shipping was fast even though it says 6 to 8 days. Got it in 4 days!!!! Will buy more in the future.,7
Quality products! First time ordering from TeePublic. Shipping was ontime. Careful packaging; fragile ceramic mug arrived safely.,7
"Love the designs.Didn't love the wait for them to show up quite as much. But I can live with that.We are in strange times.My big problem, was that I wanted more information on the shirts themselves.Like, which ones were heavy cotton, etc.Also, I love that you had shirts in 3X, 4X, and 5X. . . but I would like more choices.I am a large woman, and if you could get me a 5X in pink, I would be thrilled.I already have so many black shirts that I am beginning to look Goth. Having said that, I absolutely love the designs on my shirts, and I love that I am supporting independent artists.If we keep working from home, you are going to be my whole professional wardrobe!",7
D&D hoodie print was off center and titled XXL but fit L; also bought black received brown.Steely Dan long sleeve print was melted during transit.,7
"The package took what seemed a long time to arrive, over a week.The size was small for what it was listed and the material was extremely cheap and thin.Not at all impressed with the quality.",7
"Bought a t-shirt that showed as light to medium blue online, when it arrived it was very dark blue, so the black lettering & graphic were barely visible, didn't look anything like the picture did online.I contacted them, explained the issue, and sent a picture.They immediately responded, had me pick a different color, and the new one arrived within 2 days!It looks great, I'm super happy with the shirt and super happy with their amazing customer service.",7
"Delivered on time. I ordered a long sleeve t-shirt and I am a tall guy. The sleeve came down to my hands, so after washing it, it will still fit my arms",7

This shirt arrived quickly and is of great quality. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it���������s says ���������I���������m a swinger AT the weekend��������� I thought it said ON when I purchased because that makes more sense ,7

I love the way my shirts turned out. My daughter shirts were a little too big but I'm going to keep them. She'll grow into them. I always buy from Teepublic and have always been satisfied with my purchases. The only issue I have with Teepublic is that I wish Teepublic had free shipping and not just for purchases for 80 dollars or more but for purchases in general because depending on how many items you buy determines your shipping and tax free which is way too high even when you only purchase one item. The shipping fee along with the tax fee is just about as high as it is for just one shirt by itself.,7
Image was not as sharp as it could have been. If I would have known it was a transfer instead of ink I would probably have given the purchase a second thought.,7
The t-shirts I ordered look great. I ordered two shirts in different materials and the lower cost t-shirt was unexpectedly nice.,7
Great shirt.My granddaughter loves it.,7
"Is a ������������������������������������������������������������ service for sure !!! Starting with the very attractive price, than tee fabric quality and last but not least the stamp size and quality!!! If Im not wrong at least according to m",7
Excellent. Received quickly. Really good products.,7
The shirts look awesome! The different emails for when the order was processed and shipped were very helpful.,7
Offered to replace shirts I was not happy with.Hopefully the replacements will get here by Saturday,7
I wanted to get a Christmas gift for my boys that was creative and unique.I did a quick search of their favorite tv show and found them each a fun design.They arrived quickly and look great!,7
Each one of the shirts were just as pictured. They are perfect for the Birthday party I'm throwing.Definitely using them again,7
"I love shirts from TeePublic! I���������ve gotten several t-shirts from them & each one has been perfect! The only time I had an issue (where something was printed off-center), I contacted them & they re-sent me another shirt quickly to replace the original. Their shirts are good quality, they���������ve got tons of prints to choose from, and their customer service is great. I can also usually find them at a good price where the shirt & shipping total doesn���������t break the bank. I appreciate that too! Definitely 5 sta",7
Sweater was in terrible quality. Image was so blurry. I would have returned the sweater except the shipping time was so bad.,7
"I usually like the product, but have had to reach out to the company at times when the print quality isn���������t up to their usual standard. Their customer service has been great on that front though. My only complaint would be that I have a hard time searching the site. I���������ve had the exact name of designs and/or artists and couldn���������t get the search to locate what I was looking for. Sometimes it���������s eas",7
Excellent shipping and great quality!! My boyfriend loved his gift,7
This was my first purchase.The processing time was faster than anticipated and the shirts are beautiful!The graphics are clear and crisp.,7

"After an initial communication misunderstanding with TeePublic over a defective tee I had received, that seller addressed the issue in accordance with the guarantee on their site to fix any problem for free. They ended up handling my issue in a professional, efficient & timely manner. I recommend TeePublic highly & I will certainly be buying from TeePublic again in the future. Highly recommended.",7
Super great quality.,7

"Good contact, great design and feel.",7
Got my items in a timely manner and what I received was quality stuff!!!,7
Product came on time and was as advertised,7
"T-shirt is adorable and perfect - got a ""girl cut"" size medium and it's perfectly snug and nice quality. The image is from an obscure horror film ""A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night."" Love it!",7
"Tee Pubs is the best my wife and son both love it too! I HAVE ordered so many times i have lost count. I RECOMMEND tee pubs to friends,family and co-workers all the time",7
"TeePublic is very trust worthy. They give you high quality products as good prices, and they send your items on time. I have no issue with buying from them.",7
The sizing was great and my boyfriend loved the tshirts!! I have had other places fit small but teepublic fit well. The shipping time was also great!,7
Always love to fit and the designs that are available,7
TeePublic never disappoints. I love the great selection and multiple color choices! Very reasonable prices.,7
fast response and great products with fantastic backing.,7
Not happy with the print quality. One shirt I ordered is so faded you can hardly read it. The letters are so washed you can hardly see them. This shirt is nothing like the pictures on your website.You can also see the square back ground from the stencil used. Horrible looking and would be embarrassed to wear. I will be looking into getting my money back on that shirt as I cannot wear it. If I have to pay for a shirt and shipping and then pay to ship it back I will never buy anything from this company again. I like the shirts and planned to buy more but not if I have to pay to send them back. I would expect you all to pay for return shipping as it was defective. Merchandise I received.,7
"Great quality printing, love that there are so many options of colors!! Super comfortable hoodie!",7
"I ordered a shirt from a designer and the first time I washed and dried it, some of the design was peeling off. Loved the design of the shirt and it looked great until I washed it.",7
"Love this company, ordered many shirts but unfortunately didnt recieve one of them, when I reached out to them they were great at getting back to me in a reasonable time and sent out a replacement for the missing item.My wife and I will definitely buy more things from TeePublic in the future.",7
"Great quality, wonderful selection",7
The designs available are unique and clever but the quality of the print transfer is not great.They don't hold up as well in multiple washings.,7
Customer service is great!I accidentally ordered the wrong quality of t-shirts - I wanted the 100%cotton classic tees instead of the heather poly-cotton blend. I contacted customer service and they immediately replaced my order. I really appreciated that they did this without any hassle.,7
"No better or no worse than any internet clothing company. Annoying refrigerator magnet garbage came with order.Shirt sizing is a mess. I ordered an X-Large- I'm a big guy 6 ft, 200, 44 chest. The shirt hung down to my crotch and squeezed my body like a sausage casing. You could see my Big Gay nipples through the material which was the weave of a Handi- Wipe.",7
I truly loved the way my T-shirt fit on me. The art work was truly amazing and very neat. Also excellent customer service.,7
"This shirt was nicer and looked cooler than i even expected, and it was cheap!",7
I had items missing from my order. It was very difficult to navigate your site and find a place to relate that to you. None of the responses were appropriate but forced you to use one of them . I still have missing item and I have no idea if you got my message,7
Sizes run small-Will need to return it is the smallest large ive ever seen,7
The delivery company screwed the pooch but tpublic was very quick getting the replacement T's out with minimal to no effort on my part. The Tshirts are good quality with sizes that fit North Americans. I like mine.,7

I Love my Go Away tee shirt! I brought one for the whole family. The sizes I purchased ran a bit small so I contacted TeePublic for an exchange.The customer service is absolutely the BEST! They took care the issues in record time.I highly recommend TeePubic and purchase from them again.,7

"Awesome great concepts & Art. However would really appreciate seeing some tall sizes, I'm 6'3.....Other than that��������������������������������",7
Amazing great detail,7
It looks exactly like the picture and the shipping was so fast. Amazing!!!,7
"Initially I purchased 2 items from two sources on Teepublic. One came in fine and one wasn't great. They stepped up and made it right, which was great service. Can't give all stars given the product should never have been shipped and caused an issue as it was a gift. Great service though.",7
"Nice and came fairly fast, but there was white stuff all over it. Hopefully it comes out in the wash.",7
"I just love it,very well done! I have it on now! So many people ask me where I got it and I sure did tell them!",7

I never got any information about tracking and the order was delivered today, the 28th of April - 11 days too late for the birthday of my husband. Apart from the long time it took, we liked the item and you should be thanked for that. This did not scare me from doingbusiness with you again :)",7
The t shirt itself was really good.The size was 2X but was sized more like large instead of 2X.I would purchase more t shirts.,7

Delivery was slow. Mask size was big. Good fit though. Price was a bit much just for a mask.,7
Loved everything I received! I will definitely be placing another order!,7
"The ordering process was quick and easy, and the items were shipped in a timely manner. My only complaint is the misrepresented size of the women's t-shirts. Yes, there is a statement on the order pages about the sizes of the women's t-shirts running small, but that is an understatement. I ordered one size larger on each of the four women's t-shirts, and none of them fit. My daughter normally wears a women's small, so we ordered a medium and it is way too small. It literally looks like it's a t-shirt for a toddler. The men's t-shirts are spot on. Next time I guess I'll just order all men's sized t-shirts. :/",7
"TeePublic offers a great selection of wonderful designs. Reasonably priced, using quality materials, delivered quickly. Love their designs.",7
"I got my stuff, and the graphics were good. I think the t shirts that were used could have been better quality for the price, but it isn't something I am going to wear everyday. All in all very happy.",7

awesome shirts - great buy - I will buy again.,7
Good quality shirts. True to size. Would highly recommend. Fast Delivery. Great Price!,7
"Amazing design, great quality. I compared it to a lot of other L size shirts and it's definitely a lot larger than expected. Better too big than too small I suppose!",7
"I ordered three shirts June 9, 2020. Standard shipping is 10-25 days. I received an email on June 29 that they had shipped, with a July 6 delivery date. It is July 14 and I have still not received the shirts. I sent an email on July 8 and have not received a reply.",7
The two shirts I ordered arrived quickly and are perfect!! Great quality and even better artwork!!,7
Awesome art.. very expressive clothing! Nothing better than letting everyone know they can eat a bag of d*cks..in a nice way.,7
The unisex T's and long sleeve T's are fine but I also order a 4x women's scoop neck and it's shorter than all the other T's and not that much bigger than a unisex 2x. I'm so pissed off!!!! That 4x T was the only thing I was giving my mother for Christmas since there isn't much that parents in their mid 70's need and I know she will not be comfortable with how short it is and the slim fit it will end up being. That 1 shirt out of the 5 I ordered has me completely livid with the whole ordeal!,7
Company is great. Shirt is fantastic. The size was a bit small so they shipped out a size bigger extremely fast,7
All the shirts I got were high quality and was the right size :D,7

"Super tee, exactly as in the TeePublic shop. Delivery was on time. Will definitely order from TeePublic again.",7
"I've purchased with teepublic several times over the years but this latest hoodie I've noticed the print quality has gone down. Artwork is pixelated; and you don't have to look too closely to notice it either. I'm not sure if this is an issue with the artist's submission or the print process itself, but it's noticeable. Other than this, apparel quality is good, shipping was fast!",7
Excellent service start to finish plenty of choices great prices and quality product will definitely use this company again.,7
The shirt turned out cute!,7
I ordered ar 2X t-shirt which normally I can get by with Xlarge. It's very small. The sizing us not at all accurate. It's long enough but not nearly wide enough.,7

I have ordered twice now from Tee public. Both times I have been very satisfied! Love looking at the huge variety of designs and my college age son loves having interest specific shirts!,7
Went up an extra size and still tight. Medium womens fits like an extra small to a snug small.When ordering need to go up two sizes. Otherwise the shirt would be fine.,7
"Good quality shirt, great design exactly what was shown on website. Main problem was that the size is smaller than usual. Order Adult Large and looks like a kid x-large or adult xsmall.",7
The t-shirt is soft to the touch. But the graphic is faded and dull.,7
I have ordered 3 times each time it was effortless.,7
"The Hoodie was a gift. It was received very well. Fit Good, Looks Good!",7
"Love my Quacula pin! Looks awesome, and really brings back memories of my childhood. It's presently hanging on a pins and buttons banner with other pins and buttons featuring cartoon characters or rock musicians from my childhood days. Teepublic has wonderful service too. I would highly recommend them. A+++!",7

Items are perfect,7
I love these lowrider masks. I want to buy 2 more adult masks.,7
"TeePublic had a great assortment of shirts to fit the occasion (Christmas) and sentiments that I wanted to share with our family. The first order of 3 tees came in quickly and were of a high quality so I then ordered another 2 tees for other family members. At first glance, I was afraid the tees may be too small (size XL men's and L women's) but they fit the recipients perfectly and were worn right away. My grandson loved his Mele Kalikimaka Ukelele tee. The level of correspondence from TeePublic educated me on the process from start to finish and kept me informed of the status. This is a great way to purchase quality tees with the added bonus of supporting independent artists.",7
Great items! Fast service!,7
The shirts are really good quality not thin like a lot of these t- shirt companies. Would recommend them to anyone.,7
Shirts are great quality and comfortable.,7
"Awesome shirts,great quality,and quick delivery",7
"This is my second review since this company is awesome. Not only do they represent indie artists and showcases their awesome designs, but TeePublic has unbelievable customer service. I only wish they would print a tag on their shirts so I cam represent them every day when I wear their shirts. They helped me with a shirt that wasn���������t quite right , quickly and with no problems at all. The bonus was a magnet so guess I can represent them that way. 5 stars all around , I will never shop for shirts anyw",7
Excellent choices and friendly customer service.Corrected my order even when it was my fault.,7

"Overall, I am very pleased with selection and service but be warned, the shirts absolutely stink!! These are Christmas gifts and will have to be laundered before they can be gifted so I���������m crossing my fingers that everything fits because returns are usually not accepted after laundering. I���������m not smell sensitive and It���������s not a slight smell; so overpowering that I had to hide them in my garage because they stunk up the entire walk-in closet and master bedroom...bad enough to remove a star. If they fit and hold up to laundering, I would still order again because the selection in ",7
"Although the product is great, it was difficult to track the shipping progress. Could be the time of year or volume of packages. It did finally arrive...",7
Slow to receive. Size was small for a men's medium. More like a small than medium,7

Mug design was perfect!! Love it!,7
Shirt was a bit snug...But it took two attempts for me to get it(I never got the first one)...and I'm afraid to send the snug one back b/c it may take another 2 weeks before I get another one...Paid $27 for it. Wasn't worth it...Couldve had this made this at a local t-shirt company.,7
Received tee shirts in timely fashion and love both of them!,7
Easy site to navigate. Lots of selection. On-time delivery. Sent as a gift so I don���������t know about the quality. Site does not offer opportunity to send ,7

I had a problem with my order, emailed them and they quickly Responded AND kept emailing to fix and finalize the problem. I was super busy during that time and kind of forgot to respond, which",7
"This is the ABSOLUTE WORST customer service I have experienced in YEARS. I have contacted them several times through the ""contact"" option regarding the order I placed almost 2 weeks ago, and while my account remains CHARGED IN FULL, I have not received my order OR any response from them at all. 100% radio silence on their end, and it is infuriating. I usually shop on Ebay for these types of products, and I have learned my lesson. At least there are standards and buyer protections at Ebay... these guys have me feeling like a.completesucker. ON TOP of not having the gifts I ordered on Christmas day, I now have to consider stopping payment on my card. I understand being backed up due to holiday demand, but this is absolutely ridiculous. I am an extremely unhappy customer, and they can't even be bothered to give me a courtesy email regarding my being charged in full for an order that was never sent. Just a horrible experience all around.",7
I bought this shirt for my brother and he absolutely loves it,7
Love love love my gorgeous T shirt!! Such fast delivery too!,7

All three designs that I got were fantastic. They're Christmas gifts and I know my dad and brother will love them. I'm a frequent shopper of TeePublic and I am impressed each time by the designs the artists come up with and the quality that TeePublic prints in,7
"Ordered three shirts. Even using the size charts, all three were too small.Email customer support, got a replacement order with the correct sizes. The replacement shipment arrived with one shirt with the right size, wrong color, and shoddy processing (it looked like they used a black shirt set up on a white shirt). Another shirt was oversaturated with colors.Emailed again. Caught the automated response. Still awaiting contact.I appreciate the attention from the customer aupport staff, but maybe get a better shirt supplier that is more ""true to size"" and double checking the order would be a great improvement.",7
You carry sizes up to 5XL!I love it.Great color choices and funny t-shirts,7
My son loved his tee. His favorite Xmas present. Quality t-shirt and received before Xmas when it was expected. Would order again in the future from this seller.,7
I only ordered a few things (a mask and a few small stickers) that could have all went in one envelope. Now $40 later still waiting on the stickers.

I was very happy with my shirts. The designs were perfect as pictured on the website. The only thing was the sizing that wasn't quite perfect. The size four looked a little small. The size juvenile seven also looked a little small and I felt the youth and juvenile sizing were a bit confusing.,7

Verbiage is short and succinct. Nicely printed and colorful.,7
"I ordered a number of stickers and magnets (and one pin) relating to Good Omens and The Umbrella Academy from TeePublic. The designs themselves are all lovely--I'm delighted to support each one of the responsible artists--but the quality of the actual products leaves something to be desired. The magnets are all quite lovely, if rather delicate. The ink, colors, and printing quality is perfection, but the sheet magnet on which they are printed is so thin that they take on the shape of any depression they are placed over, and I worry that over time, they will be quick to dry out and crack anywhere they aren't completely flat, which could prove to be a problem, given that my refrigerator where they will be going, has that slight kind of marbled texture to it that's so common. The stickers are the real disappointment, though; while the sticker paper has a nice, smooth texture, the quality of the printing is so poor as to be nearly-unusable. Each design is riddled with pixel-y splotches that make it appear as if the printer were running low on color or something, except that every single sticker looks like that on every single color, and it makes it look like someone decided to use good old fashioned TV static as the fill-texture. I am deeply disappointed with the quality of these stickers and am quite irritated about how much money I spent on the lot of them when this is what they look like. My advice is, do NOT waste any of your hard-earned mulah on these horrid stickers. If there's a design you really like, do yourself a favor and spend a little extra getting it as a magnet, or perhaps some other product, though I can't speak to the quality of anything else. But seriously, stay away from the stickers. They are actual garbage.",7
No problems on my end. The shirts were delivered faster than I thought and are exactly what we were looking for.,7
"Service was so slow, I had to cancel order before receiving it as I no longer needed it. Waited three weeks for shipment confirmation and my order never was made or shipped. I asked for my card to be refunded. I hope that doesn't take as long.",7
Your emails seem to be a bit lagged and give the impression that the tshirts were not ordered. They came but I got quite a few emails saying that my cart was going to expire. I���������m happy they got here on time. The tshirts have a smell however. Not sure if it���������s ,7
The shirts came out exactly as I wanted and they were a gift. The fit was great also and the quality of the shirts was better than most.,7

Shirts are exactly as advertised and fit me perfectly! Great array of designs as well.,7
Good quality t-shirtdelivery as advertised.,7
"It's a very nice shirt. Comfortable, soft fabric, it was very form fitting just how I like it. The only reason I had rated it 4 stars was because I'm not entirely sure as to how the logo will hold up just yet. Very happy with this purchase as I have a had a very difficult time finding a Womens WoW T-shirt that isn't oversized, had only Alliance or Horde symbols, or only had female characters on it.",7
I want a refund and I paid extra for shipping and I am very unhappy with the shirts I order for my son 1st birthday.. I ordered white shirts and got ivory & off white shirts then the picture that I seen online was not the same picture I received on the shirtsand I want my money returned to me .

"Non responsive customer service, delayed delivery, and poor product quality. I still remain with an unresolved refund issue for a credit to my account which was granted to me in writing but no one has addressed, even though emails were sent. Trying to explain the nature of the closed bank card account where the refund did not go through is futile. I am tired or writing, and seek action for resolution. Extremely dissatisfied customer. It was my first time ordering from TeePublic and my LAST!!!!!!",7
The hoodie was a gift for my niece and she loved it!,7
"We received a fridge magnet for Sleeping Bear Dunes in the mail.I had ordered it after we returned from vacation as a souvenir from our trip to Michigan (we didn't find a souvenir shop near there).When we received it in the mail, my wife said, ""It's beautiful!""That's good enough for me.It now sits proudly on the refrigerator.",7
"I had a delivery issue, and the customer service was beyond excellent",7
"The t-shirts are good quality, not thin or sheer.The color and print on the shirts did not fade during the first wash.I ordered an extra large based on the sizing chart on the website.The shirts are a little long on me but I'm only 5'3. Otherwise, it is a good fit in the bust and waist.I prefer my tops to fit loosely.",7
"The sizes are very inaccurate, I order size large and it looks like small size. I give this a 5 star because the customer service was very helpful and sent the right fit.",7
"I love the concept of this and ordered 7 Tees for Christmas. The biggest issue is the huge discrepancy in sizes. Of the 7 I ordered, I think 4 will be appropriate size wise. I ordered up for all the womens Tees to a size large and they still are very small looking (and short).",7
"I received what I ordered fairly fast considering the current state of affairs concerning shipping. Quality is nice but nothing has been washed yet so that will be the true test.One shirt had to be returned because of a sizing issue and it was handled promptly and efficiently. I was very happy with that process. I would urge everyone to review their sizing charts, especially when it comes to women's sizes. If I had done that I wouldn't have had a problem.I will buy from TeePublic again.",7
"Takes awhile to get, but it's worth it. Just wish all the shirts weren't black (Summer weather here!)",7

"Was really nice, fit great.It was a gift for my dad who loves UFC and Chuck Liddell. The only little detail I noticed is when ordered in black, Chuck Liddell blends into the black while the rest of the print was blue, which was nice.

Loved product. 2nd product I ordered from them.Wil order other products,7
I would highly recommend TeePublic.....for Christmas I ordered 4 tees and when they arrived the sizes ran so small they were of no use to me.I contacted TeePublic offering to return them for a large size and they replaced all the tees (with no problems) for a larger size and told me I did not need to return the small ones.To say I was surprised and pleased is an understatement!!I have recommended TeePublic to friends and just last night a friend ordered 2 after hearing my story.My only recommendation is that they state how small the sizes run.,7

"Really cute shirts, I bought Coffee Boy and the She likes me more shirts in large for my husband, they fit really nice, are quite slendering too. They are a thinner fabric though so am afraid they will shrink a lot, hoping they don���������t. They did take a longer time to get, but I",7

"The good:items arrived within 1 week of placing order, print quality on T-shirt was fantastic, on lightweight sweatshirt, it wasn't as vibrant, but still rather decent. The same can be said of the print quality on face masks I have purchased:on some items, print quality was excellent, on other masks, it was at least acceptable. However, vibrancy of colors and and positioning of prints did not remain consistent between 6 different basic and pleated double layer masks. The quality of the fabrics used for the classic T-shirt (female fit) and lightweight hoodie were better than expected;both articles seem sturdy, like they won't pill or fall apart after a few washes. Again with the masks, quality of fabrics was at least acceptable.The less desirable:even when purchasing with 30% discount, items were priced a bit high (especially considering cost of shipping) compared with quality of goods received. Sizing guide for female fit classic T difficult to accurately gauge based on pictorial guide (no measurements, nor mentions or reviews on details regarding materials, like if they are are preshrunk, available for consideration), and nearly impossible to determine for lightweight hoodie (no measurements, recommendations, or photo guidelines offered whatsoever), making acquiring accurate sizes very challenging. Considering that one is to spend about $20, plus $7 shipping on 1 T-shirt (or $40 + $10 shipping on a lightweight hoodie) before taxes are even calculated, this seems like a very poor oversight on behalf of the company, regardless of the promises made by 1their fit guarantee.The double layer and basic face masks were very inconsistent in quality. Some masks were very well-sewn, holding up over 2 years of usage, despite rampant abuse by younger male crotch gobblins (AKA kids). Other masks purchased were not nearly as well-constructed, with neither accurately aligned/displayed printed designs, nor able to stay intact after more than 2 weeks of gentle usage and washing by conscientious adults without falling apart.Overall, I might consider ordering items from TeePublic again, based on the quality of items received and the opportunity to support independent artists. However, I would do so with great trepidation unless either offered another minimum promotion of 40% discount, or possibly if more accurate sizing guidelines and/or verified item reviews were to become available.",7
So cute!! Exactly what I wanted!!,7

Great shirts. Fast shipping.,7
"Great quality, super fast shipping!Couldn���������t be happier! Merry Christmas!��",7
I gave 2 stars for 2 reasons. 1. The shipping took longer then estimated. I ordered it to take with me to go outta town by 4 days. It was delivered the day I left 4 days after it was supposed to be delivered. I would of paid to get it expedited if I knew it would run that far behind. 2. The quality of the sweatshirt was nice. The printing on the subpar. Also I ordered a white sweatshirt and it wasn���������t protected at all. The white sweatshirt was shipped in the shipping bag only. So of course when it was delivered it was raining & there was a hole in the bag. So my white sweatshirt was wet with stains. If the sweatshirt was protected in some type of plastic bag and then placed in the shipping bag I probably wouldn't be wr,7

I got what I ordered and in a very timely manner. I love my shirt and have ordered from this company before. I love the unique shirts and will order again!!,7
Art was great. Print itself looks good. But the shirt quality is very low. I can see right through it. Another shirt I have purchased was not this poor of quality.,7

The shirts are true to size and they were received quickly.,7
"I ordered 7 shirts. 4 of the 7 prints did not look as they did on the site. One of the prints had streaks through it and the colors were off to the point where you couldn't see some of the picture. 3 of the shirts that I ordered in a Male/Large all fit differently and on closer inspection they were all a different type of Large shirt. At checkout on the site there is no way to change the size of the shirt you want so you need to remove the one in your cart and then re-add it. During this process I didn't change on of the shirts from female to male and ordered the wrong shirt. I know I should have been more diligent in checking my cart over, but this all could have been avoided if the checkout process had some easy change options for your order(like many other sites do). I sent in pictures showing the prints were bad and saying that I would like to exchange for the right size. I specifically asked if the exchange would cost me anything. Customer service was very quick to respond and set up an order for the reprints with rush shipping and for the exchange, charging me for the exchange, which I wouldn't have bothered with if I knew it was going to cost me. On receiving the the new prints they had the same defects as the previous prints. Pros:The shirts are soft, wash well, most of the shirts with the simpler prints are fine, they were fairly inexpensive since they were on sale, and customer service was quick to respond. Cons: Not being able to easily change my order. sizing between shirts varies quite a bit, and the prints simply don't do the artists justice. Some of the colors are way off, the details are blurred, and the shirt I was most looking forward to has very noticeable vertical lines where there shouldn't be any.",7

One of the best stores to buy unique designs. The shirts are well-made and comfortable. I highly recommend.,7
Tee public did an amazing job.The product I ordered was exactly as I seen online and is of good quality was also delivered in a timely manner and they stayed in touch with me on tracking my order.I would recommend them to anyone that sees a product they like especially in this day of so many scams out there they are legit and very professional,7
TeePublic has the cutest tees! The ones I ordered were perfect and I can't wait to show them off to my co-workers! Thanks to the artists that created them! #yourock,7
Great place to get awesome shirts love all of my shirts I bought will buy again,7
The shirts are good quality.These are all Christmas presents,7
"Although the ad stated that the shirts are small for their size, they are REALLY small for their size, and should be relabeled appropriately. The Large women's t-shirt is really a women's Small (not a Medium as stated in the ad).",7
"This shirt runs very small. I usually wear a 1x but I like shirts a little looser, so I ordered a 2x. It fits like a size L. Can�������",7
I received the wrong size. I may have ordered the wrong thing. I requested help with an exchange and was contacted on how to get the right items.,7
"Love my purchase.The shipping was delayed due to the holidays, but customer service was fantastic.Very happy with the experience overall!The sizes do run QUITE small, so I was glad I took the advice on the website and sized up.They're definitely my new favorite tops!",7
Shirt came with an unexpected... watermark?,7
"I've bought 3 tees already and so far I have no complaints. The shipping time is actually really fast considering that they have to print each t-shirt upon sale. The only thing that they could improve is the actual print quality, it is not the best that I've seen, that's why I don't give 5 stars, but besides that, I like TeePublic and will keep buying from them!",7
"My son wanted a Technoblade hoodie. We researched which size to order to make sure it would fit him. When my son received the hoodie, it was an adult L instead of a youth L. I contacted the company and they quickly sent a replacement in an adult S. We didn't have to worry about shipping or anything. They were great about replacing it!",7
Everything was great.Timing is a little slow but that was tolerated.We need artists to express the times now as what I purchased showed a fist bump of a relationship between parent and child.We need a fist bump between human to human aside from color of our skin as our internal innards are all the same.,7
It is a nice shirt and over all I have no complaints I would buy again,7
"The colors, the design, the size, everything is perfect !",7
"great customer service, great shirt quality",7
Shirts arrived very quickly and are of good quality.Only word of advice for women would be to order 2 sizes up.I ordered 1 size up and they fit a tiny bit snug which is fine as it's going to motivate me to lose the weight I planned on dropping anyhow.,7
The shirt I ordered came quickly and is a very good quality. I also love supporting independent artists.,7

The picture is good. The shirt kinda thin but my nephew like it,7
Love the shirts every single time!!,7
It took plan up forever to get here instead of take a week and took two,7
Over all the service was great. The only thing was the T-shirt was a classic T. I was thinking it was a real classic cut. You know the loose feel. This Tee was the newer skin tight fit. That is not a classic cut. If I had know that. I would have ordered a 2xl. Real classic cut fit more comfortably than the midlife crisis cut.Other than that it is a great product.,7
"Love it,can't wait for my 2 year old grandson opens it Christmas",7
"My ceramic mug arrived in a secure, sturdy box.The art design was as pictured and the over look of the cup is very appealing.",7

"I ordered 2 Ts. Both are good work and quality shirts. But (isn't there always a but?) the white words on the pale pink T just don't show up. Luckily I'm resourceful and have some fabric pens, so I will just outline the words. But in the future you might want to either use a darker ink for pale pastel shirts or not offer the pale shirts when you can provide only lettering in white ink.",7
I had a problem with my order and emailed customer service. I received a reply in less than 30 minutes. Theyfixed my problem and sent out a new order all within about an hour. I will definitely be recommending TeePublic to family and friends.,7
"Definitely gonna buy stuff again because lemme tell you the quality of the shirt was insane and the return policy is outstanding. I had gotten a shirt for my brother as a gift and it didn't fit him unfortunately and teepublic sent me a replacement no questions asked. Loved the service, quality, everything!!!",7

Shirts were great but the hoodie was much smaller in size and bought all large sizes.,7

$16 a shirt is not too bad. The material and fit of the shirts themselves is great. The printing seems high quality and durable. The selection of prints is staggering. I am very happy with my purchase and will probably come back in the future. There are many more shirts I would like to buy.,7

Great design! Fast delivery,7
"How shirts fit vary based on type of shirt, so as you get a nicer shirt, softer, or even different color the fit will be different.That is the only negative I have run into.Apart from that delivery is great, quality is great, and selection is best out there.",7
Beautiful shirt.i am thrilled to get it and was especially thrilled to see it arrive so quickly.I would recommend anyone who needs a special tee to your site and your artists.,7
"The purchasing process was very easy. I was kept informed by email of every stage of my purchase and delivery.I was very surprised how quickly I received my Tshirt.My Tshirt looked just like it was advertised. This was a great, first purchase experience.",7

Quality was awful but customer service was stellar in quickly replacing my order.,7
"The quality of the shirts is amazing, as long as you follow the washing guidelines the print lasts so much longer than the competitors!",7
"I received my order without issue. Size was perfect for my daughter. She absolutely loves it. My only issue with it was I thought the colors would have been printed brighter. Obviously the internet picture rarely shows products as is, but the colors seemed darker than need be. Other than that great product!",7
"Item quality is good enough, but the length of a medium tee is too long. All the other fittings seem to be good, other than the length.",7
"Love it, bright colors, good quality.",7
The graphics on the tshirt is a nice thick print not like some i have gotten where they skimp on the printing,7
Fast shipping and the shirts are good quality. Nice colors,7
"I absolutely love these designs! I was so excited for my partner to open these, but I was a little disappointed to see that the premium relaxed fit tee was tighter on him than the classic fit tee that I got him. I thought I was paying extra for a more comfortable fit that would feel a little more loose. I still am beyond happy with my purchase. He is sooo sooo happy and said that I win Christmas this year!!",7

"The shirts are great. First, the v-neck shirt run long like they are for big and tall. Second, the quality of the shirts are wonderful. Third, the printing quality is sub par. The first shirts I received were supposed to have red lettering on black shirt. Half the lettering was almost pint and half was a faded red like it had been washed a 100 times. It���������s like a dot printer ran out of ink.Instead of using pure red ink it uses a combination of ink colors to create red so you can see white under tones beneath it on the lettering edges. This is true for the v-neck versions and the classic round neck. Nothing wrong with the shirts, but the screen printing or what ever technique is used is horrible. I don���������t mind with the whit print on black, although the white could be brighter, but the �������",7

"Made two orders. First order arrived but one of the shirts was the wrong design. Customer service did a good job making it right, but when the replacement shirt arrived the design looked very ""worn"" and transparent. The second order, I purchased another shirt that was the same design as my first order for my buddy. The second shirt had a much more blurry image than the first design that was ordered literally a week beforehand. The quality of this company is very hit or miss.",7
"Great shipping status updates, but I was not impressed with the actual product. The print was very foggy and the letters in the shirt were indecipherable.",7
Great Service!. Quality products!,7
"Everything I have ordered is perfect,fast and just as promised! Love this site:)",7
"First let me say that once I finally received the 3 clothing items that I ordered, I was absolutely pleased with them.Great quality and fit!However, and maybe because my order was place during early Covid-19 quarantine, I didn't receive it for about a month and a half, and had no contact from the company to let me know of the status.When my charge bill was due, I filed a dispute, because the order status still showed ""received"", and it had been about a month.I had no idea whether I'd ever even see the goods, but had already been charged (on the order date)!For the high price I paid for shipping, it certainly should have arrived sooner.Just don't be in a rush!",7
"This is my second order of T-shirts, both short and long sleeve. I was in the 5th Inf. Div. Mechanized, attached to the 77th Armor. The artwork is perfect.It has my 77th Armor patch and the 5th Infantry patch which is a red diamond. It shows the armor cavalry logo and combat ribbons.I have not found any other place which offers so much.I get more compliments from veterans on this which is good.",7

I love the designs offered by TeePublic designers and the quality of the t-shirt was okay for the $13 I paid for it on sale but I don���������t know if I would have purchased this at regular price. The reason for the two stars was that the screen print of the artwork was terrible. It���������s a simple 1 color design and all 3 of the shirts I ordered the material used for the print is cracking all over. I received them like this I have not even washed th,7
"I had a great experience. I ordered three t shirts for my 12 year old. It took a few weeks, which was understandable since they're printing for the order. The shirts are good quality, 100% cotton, and the prints are clean. We haven't washed them yet, so I can't speak to how they hold up. At this point I'd definitely order from teepublic again. I just wish I could design my own as well because I have some things in mind that I couldn't find among the options.",7

Update: They sent a replacement in a new color. After 3 weeks this new hoodie has pilled so badly it looks 5 years old.

"I ordered a shirt and when it arrived, the black ink looked light brown and the quality of the print was not good. I reported it to them and they sent me a second one right away.

I purchased a hoodie from here for my daughter that was absolutely perfect and looked just like her MX-5 Miata (NC2)! She loved it ������,7
"I uploaded my designs as professional artist and right at the 48 hour window to see how many sells you obtained, they deactivated my account and said I violated terms and conditions without giving me any further information. I repeatedly contacted them without any reply other than auto generated things directing me to terms and conditions. I have absolutely no idea how I violated these terms and conditions.",7
"The price is great, but unfortunately I don't think the quality is great. After one wash the shirts look years old. And the inconsistencies with sizing makes it hard to keep ordering.A 2XL with one supplier vs the next is way off. It either fits perfectly or fits a 300 pound man. Who wants to be sending things back especially when it's made to order.",7
Great service. Great policies. Great product.,7
"I love the case, but it barely fits the computer it's supposed to hold.Hopefully it will stretch and loosen up a bit, but if it doesn't the zipper or a seam is going to be compromised in short order.No room for the power cord, though since it's not a full blown briefcase, maybe that was to be expected.I love the design and color on the case.Exactly what I was looking for.",7

I purchased a jabbawockeez shirt which I love I want to a show in Las Vegas August 2022 and I love this,7
I've ordered several t-shirts each time. Love the material & many colors to choose from. Just a suggestion....if it would be possible to have a small option on the front & the large transfer for the back or just a small option for the front. Also I realize it is impossible to have transfers for everywhere but ask would it be possible to do a custom? I'm an international traveler who collected t-shirts and had hundreds. Sadly we suffered a house fire and all of my travel treasures were lost. I can't really replace unless I return to places. There is too much world to see so will visit new unexplored countries. Really do love the t-shirts I've bought this far. I have another order ready to place.Many Thanks.....,7

"My shipment arrived quickly and the items were as described. However, the shirts are not of great quality. I paid extra to have tri-blend extra soft shirts, but they're thin and not as soft as some other blended shirts I've bought from other vendors. Additionally, the sleeves are somewhat loose and not as round - a sign to me that the quality is lacking. These shirts are not what I had hoped for for the $22 pricetag, but they're not bad enough to return for a refund.",7

The quality of the baseball style T-shirt was not great. Very thin and the print quite faded already. I bought an XL which was fine width wise but very short. My son still loved it for nostalgia sake but I know it's too short and will only shrink more when he washes it.,7

"Ordered 6 t-shirts. While I like the designs and service, delivery, the shirts themselves could be of a better quality. They are too thin and light, in my opinion.

"The shirt had been listed simply and the product pictures were perfectly accurate to the shirt in person. It also arrived much sooner than projected, so that is a duel congratulation for Tee Public and the postal service for their efficiency, well done all.",7
The products were very nice and arrived quickly.,7
These are very nice tee shirts at a great price!,7
"I couldn't be happier - all 5 tees ordered are wonderful! One of them arrived days before the others, so there was a little panic as the packing list indicated nothing about others on their way and the website said everything would be shipped together. However, the other 4 arrived in time and the designs are fabulous.",7
I absolutely love the shirts I ordered! The company was responsive when o had a question and I'll definitely order more in the future!,7
The shirt looked great but was a little flimsy.,7
"Ordering was easy, selection was great, shipping (even with a delay) was perfect!",7
"The black medium t-shirt is OK. Made of a better quality of cotton compared to the XXL, which is dog crap cuz it's made of a shittier quality of cotton and will shrink considerably after washing. One reason why I hate buying apparel online, but this was a shirt for my son (the black) and me (the light blue) to wear together. Doubt that will ever happen now due to the XXL being crap.",7
I love the designs but the 3T is so small it doesn���������t fit my nephew who wears a 3T. I am really disappointed he can���������t wear his Siracha shirt. I love your d,7
"Great speed, responsiveness and delivery time",7
"Excelent service, and love the designs ����",7
I have ordered many t���������s from this unit and they���������ve delivered each time. I���������m an old-school r&b head. And this group of talented garment artists hit the mark with my wants every time. From Marvin Gaye to EW&F to The Jackson Five to A Tribe Called Quest! This group of artists have created for me,7
Excellent shirt. Came early too.,7
I love these masks I wear them everyday at work and I get lots compliments,7
Excellent quality and customer service that is quick to respond and fix any issues with your order.Speedy creation and delivery.Highly recommended! I have made multiple purchases and will be back! ����,7
"The sizes are confusing. The small is too small, the medium is really small. Good thing I have ordered in both sizes. Too bad small will go to Salvation Army.",7
Love their tshirts but a little on the thin side,7
"TeePublic is awesome! Not only are you supporting independent artists with these unique products, but the customer service is amazing! I had such a great experience with my first order that I went back and got another few things for Christmas presents.",7
"Fast, clean clear colors, good tee weight, very good sizing drop down. I���������",7
"I am totally satisfied with the product; also, I was kept informed of the tracking process.",7
"The shirt was great, but where the hell are my stickers?",7
Prompt service and good sizing descriptions.,7
"The tees were great but one of the shirts sent was obviously a youth XL instead of an adult XL as ordered and marked. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to return it before we had intended to gift it so we were disappointed. We will order again in the future but wish our order had been checked for accuracy before sending.",7
The art work is original and fresh and entertaining.I love the shirt selection and my laptop is covered with your stickers.You'll be receiving more orders from me in the future!,7
The stickers came pretty quick.They are so cute.Packaging was easy-to-use.I love ������������������,7
"Great selection,cool shirts fit well and get alot of comments on my designs.",7
"Love it <3 its literally my favorite thing to wear, ever!",7
"Product is nice and came quickly, I would have given 5 stars if the shirt had not smelled so terrible. Not sure what it was but I had to wash it before I could give it as a gift.",7
"Ordered 5 shirts , Great Quality Print, Really good shirt ( (I got the cheapest option). Really Happy, no complaints - excited for the future - many more projects to come because of this great service!",7
"So far everything has been great. Shirts and stickers are exactly as ordered. When I first ordered from Teepublic I was uncertain because I never heard of it, but now my experience with order has made me a customer five times now I think.",7
The print quality is great and the fabric is really soft and comfortable.,7
I love every shirt. My only complaint is that the actual t-shirt is cheaper and the neck stretches horribly even in the washer.,7
"Quality of screen print is so so. The hoodie ordered well, lets just say ill have to be careful with when washing and the seond item was a t-shirt which has a faint black mark below the screen print. So, not sure what happened there but i will be contacting them about this.",7
"Fast shipping, great quality",7
Customer Service !!!! Best ever Love their shirts. I called with a problem. My mistake. They fixed it before I could blink. Outstanding !!,7
Ordering is easy and my t-shirt was here in 5 days.,7
Bought a size too small and needed an exchange.Went online and ordered. A shirt was sent immediately no charge.,7
"Staff had been very helpful and fair. Freely replacing a blurry tapestry.My only complaint is the low quality shipping used with standard orders. Very slow,and one order just dissapeeared for over a week.",7
"This shirt is great! Print quality is great and the shirt its self is just a little on the long side, which I prefer. Definitely would order from this artist/company again, their work is great!",7
"All of the shirts were great, I didn't realize the 90's greats would be pixelated",7
It was a gift for my son. He loved it.,7
"The shirts looked great, were comfortable, and fit well..I'm very pleased.. shipping took about 10 days, which isn't bad.",7
"I have ordered from this website before and have never had any problems with ordering, delivery, or product. Very well organized with a huge variety of great products and they always have so many deals going on!",7
"nice shirt, prompt delivery,",7
Product was great! Came in a timely fashion,7
Perfect. Exactly as described,7
Quick response and extremely efficient. You guys are the best.,7
"great design, very fast turnaround",7
Had a problem ordering on Website.I wanted 6 shirts and had to do 3 different orders because it would not add up shirt sizes and changes I made while ordering.I got my 15% off on first two orders... but I had to at the end of day pay 3 $6.95 shipping charges..so no savings.Think this is a bad glitch in Website.I am happy with shirts..but it was frustrating ordering aa Website did not make changes correctly.,7
The T-shirts I ordered are dope. Great designs and the quality is nice. It took it 5 days to get to me which is nice onb. Overall I'm satisfied ����,7
"Quality shirt print, fast shipping despite the issues at hand with getting things delivered.",7
"Lousy service, I hated my time spent trying to sell through this company. Not even sorry they canceled meand forced me to go to a competitor. One shirt started pealing after the first wash talk about crap product.",7
Exactly what I hoped I was getting and all delivered in one shipment!,7
Great customer service!,7
I loved the sweatshirt but when it came it was a but scratched up. I reached out to TeePublic about an exchange and they got back very quickly and were very cooperative. Would buy again.,7
I love supporting TeePublic! I received a tshirt for Christmas that was too small for me and TeePublic made the exchange really easy. This wasn't the first purchase that my family made and it won't be the last. I love supporting other artists!,7
"The t-shirt is lovely! It arrived promptly, even though I ordered it in the Christmas season. It fits true to size and is very soft. I was pleased with the quality.I would definitely recommend this company!",7
I ordered around 10 shirts all but 1 was exactly what I wanted! I only had a small issue with one of the shirts with the picture on the front being very distorted. It has the golden girls on it and they almost look like cartoons. Other than that one shirt they were awesome.,7
"Best customer service! I had issues with delivery (100% the post office���������s fault) and never received my package, but teepublic replaced it immediately. The shirts and sweater I purchased are all grea",7
The quality of the shirt we received is top notch! I was very impressed with the ease of ordering and the prompt arrival of our shirt!,7
When the shirts were made wrong. Teepublic made them right! Quality issues were addressed and the shirts were reprinted and replaced. But with confidence! Your satisfaction is guaranteed!!!!,7
"These folks are awesome. Took care of my return so fast and were so nice, of course I'm buying more. (Yesterday)",7
Great customer service and a phenomenal selection of t-shirts,7
Locating the individual items on the website was difficult at times and sometimes it was easy to use the search function to get exactly what I was looking for. However the rest of the experience and the design was great! Exactly what my daughter was,7
I really love the shirts...I just hated the fact that I had to wait over a month to get my shirts. I'm hoping it is just the pandemic situation and not the fact that it actually takes over a month to get my purchase. So I won't penalize them this time....,7
Print is very good but sizes run very small,7
"The design on the tee was point on, but your sizing was off by alot. Gave the tee to my 8 yr old granddgt.",7
"I ordered five items from TeePublic, two shirts and three masks. The three masks were misrepresented in the pictures on TeePublic���������s web site, and what I received were nowhere close to what TeePublic showed. I respectfully asked for a refund of the purchase price, since it was TeePublic���������s mistake and not mine, and my request was denied by Ioana. She instead offered me 30% off my next order. Why would I want to place another order when 60% of my last order was wrong? TeePublic not standing behind their own products is bad business. I will never order anything else from TeePublic since it appears they refuse to correct their mistakes and care nothing about their customers��������� being satisfied with their products.UPDATE:After refusing to do anything to correct their mistake with my order, TeePublic sent a second email stating that ���������they were sorry to hear about the trouble with my order and that they would love to  contacted them once. They denied my request to do the right thing and correct my order. How many times am I supposed to ask them to send me what I paid for and/or let me return the products they sent wrong and give me a refund?",7
Initial thoughts: Fast service and shipping.All products looked great with excellent graphics.Sizes seem to be true to fit.The only thing that remains to be seen is how well they wear.Great place to purchase interesting shirts from a creative community.Highly recommended!,7
Swift response very helpful will definitely buy again,7
"shirt was great, shipping was great, price was great. everything was great :)",7
Product was of low quality for the price paid.Response from tee public was to send pictures......well.....you sent them....you know the quality and the price I paid.Do not suggest doing business this way.Very dis satisfied.I wish we could have worked out a solution.Loved the design.,7
T-shirt came quickly and was as described.Can���������t wait to give,7
"Prompt service and good communication. But I wish the white letters on the black hoodie had retained their brightness. Maybe you should come up with a better way to handle white letters on black fabric. These letters are kind of dull and faded looking, just blending into the black. No crisp edges. It���������s ok, and I���������m keeping i",7
"I love my shirt, it���������s super soft and the colors are gorgeous! It made my entire month when I got it! I���������m soooo in love with it, I don���������t really know why I didn���������t get things from TeePublic so",7
Can't wait to wear our shirts to the concert!I would buy from here again.But like others have said-- order the next size up!,7
Great experience. The whole process was easy and great quality product,7
All 3 prints from the male 2XL were off to one side... they were suppose to be Christmas gifts. :((((,7
"I love my Tee Public shirts and sweatshirts, and they make great gifts.There are so many unique designs, and lots of fabric and fit choices. The prices are good and the shipping is super fast.I���������ve ordered many times and will order m",7
"Love my new tee shirts! As suggested, I ordered 2 sizes up from what I normally wear. Usually wear a unisex M, but got a ladies XL. Just the fit I like. I also came quicker than I anticipated, but good communication on where my shirts were in production/ shipping.",7
My design on my shirt is slanted an uneven,7
Great product! Looks awesome,7
Tshirt full of stains... Was offered little to no help in rectifying the situation other than to wash the shirt and a snarky remark afterwards,7
"The quality of the shirt was fine, but the color of the design was not at all as advertised. The site showed a bright teal color but I received a pale somewhat transparent baby blue colored design. I emailed customer service, but haven���������t heard back in 3 days. Won��",7
"In short���������wow!. I ordered two t-shirts on the same size but one was too small. No questions asked, Tee Public answered my query and organised the right size to be sent out to me. Excellent customer service which i",7
I love buying my t-shirts here!,7
Nice quality shirts.Excellent customer service!!!Will definitely buy from again.,7
Fast delivery and a great product. This was my first purchase with TeePublic and I'll be sure to purchase again in the future.,7
Great shirts at a good prices shipped quickly to your home. What else can you ask for?,7
Quick and Looks great!!Fun Christmas Gift.,7
"Great selection, quality and quick shipping. I will definitely buy from them again.",7
Very good service! I���������m happy with the product I���������ve got but the only issue I had was that the design on my T-shirt still smelled of glue like it was still fresh but apart from that it�������,7
I haven't tried it on yet but it seems to begood quality at a cheaper price than a lot of places.Delivery was prompt considering the time of year.,7
tees are comfy and prints are as expected,7
Exceptional products and customer service.,7
Love my t-shirt! Very soft.,7
Love this company but I wish they would take a little more care about centering the design on your shirt. It would also be nice to lift the designs up 2��������� on the larger sized shirts so it���������s actually on us ,7
"Great T-shirt!Love my new shirt, design looks great and the material is super soft and comfortable.Shipping was fast.I'm glad to be able to support the artist.",7
"Nice shirt,and cool design,very satisfiedwith the product.i would recommend teepublic for anyone looking for a cool designed prouduct.",7
Always took care of me fast one shirt the ink flaked off shirt was replaced in a few days another time the shirt said it was a xxxl but it was only a xxl the shirt maker had mis labled it I let them know about the problem I got a new shirt in a few days I think this lets you know got a problem let them know Ooo I have ordered 30 plus shirts,7
Love the shirt. Curious to see how it launders since it is 100% cotton,7
"I bought ToffeeDesigned & sold by ContenebratioTank2XL, Female Fit, Premium Racerback, BlackQty: 1 I looks great it was a little tight but I can stretch it some. Would order again and would recommended it to a friend.",7
Excellent! Loved it.,7
The print is really bad. The yellow spider is very faded. Nothing like the example. What is the return policy?,7
"The shirt turned out AWESOME. I was given two for some reason, but I guess my girlfriend can have a matching shirt with me haha!Great work!",7
"Brilliant design, well made t shirt and excellent fit.",7
I ordered 3 t-shirts and they arrived in a timely manner. The shirts were VERY cute and my family. The shirt didn't fit my mom and we tried to exchange it but they just sent us another one free! Very fun company and can't wait to order again :),7
"I gave it a 3 out of 5 stars because I thought the color in the transfers did not come out all that vibriant as in the pictures online. The designs on some of the shirts look like cheap iron-ons with muted color. I���������m not sure I would order again. The quality of the clothing is very good but I feel like I could do the same with a printer, iron on transfer sheets and clothing bought at a craft store. I was hopin",7
Great shirt. Well constructed.,7
I love the design on my sweatshirts.I have never ordered from here before so ordering two was a risk for me. Received both together and it didn't take long at all. The sweatshirts fit perfectly and love how they look.,7
I had a product issue and it was handled promptly and without any problems just as they indicate. Excellent Customer Service and great products.A+++++,7
Super soft tshirt. Logo was perfect! True to size.,7
Super fun shirts but they shrunk in the wash :(,7
Got the wrong size for the 2 shirts i ordered. Well the shirts were right but the measurements were wrong. Customer service got back to me within a day or so and the day after the replacements were in the way,7
"Love the items I have received.Even when there is an issue, it's quickly and completely handled!",7
Working with customer service for a replacement. The one sent to me was BLURRY and double printed. Horrible.,7
"Great products, quality and shipping.",7
I always like the products but prices are high for quality you get. Also shipping costs are extremely expensive and I believe it's just another way to increase their profits! I only order when there's a sale as it's way over priced!,7
I bought 2 T-Shirts and a Hoodie for my 8 year old son and for my 5 year old daughter from Morejstu and they���������re in love with the product! My self thinks the printing could be a better quality but so far we think it�������,7
"I ordered two T-shirts to go along with novels that students in my class are reading. The shirts came quickly, were of great quality, and fit well! I would definitely recommend to others!",7
Good quality.Wide selection although not as cutting edge as I would prefer.Shipping costs are a bit high.,7
Shirt was great quality and exactly what we ordered! Love it!,7
We were not completely satisfied with the first shirt we ordered. We ordered something completely different for our replacement & we are very happy with it & the quality of the apparel.,7
"They are perfect. I just hope they fit. But the quality is great, the fabric (all cotton) is not thin or cheap looking. Very substantial and will last. The printing came out great as well. I would definitely order again from this company. I was checking out their design options and already found a few really cool ones I���������ve never seen anywhere before. I�",7
The quality of the tees I got was great. Really nice job on the graphics /printing and the actual t shirt was a good quality. The prices were very reasonable and the shopping fast with a lot of updates on the status. I also was really excited about the variety of designs and styles of shirts and other products,7
All came before Christmas and just great quality tbh got my bro two motley crew t shirts and he's over joyed...most cause he's lost weight and needed some new band shirts lol but yeah good stuff,7
Great designsThey treat the artist fairly & make it easy for the artist to sell their imagesThe product quality is great too! Just wish shipping wasn���������t q,7
"I found what I was looking for, placed order, they were great on keeping me updated and am very pleased with it.",7
Very fast shipping and the t-shirt was great! Great work!,7
Great designs and great service. My only complaint is that the website doesn't play nicely with ad blockers.,7
"I���������ve bought 3 shirts so far, I love them and they always make others laugh. They are funny and unique which is why I bought them. My only negative is on the first shirt I bought, is after a dozen or so washes it is starting to peel, hopefully the two new shirts I bought they will make it a little longer. Regardless for the price, you can�",7
"Great design, okay shirt.",7
An incorrect short design was sent to me. The issue was resolved to my satisfaction the same day I e-mailed a complaint. Good service.,7
My niece loves this website,7
I initially had problems paying through their system then a staff member helped sort it out then he cancelled the order instead of another one but eventually another member of staff got it sorted so a bit of hassle but the quality of the product was very good so would buy from them again for this reason,7
"I've ordered several items from TeePublic, mostly shirts and masks. The quality is great, and fair prices. Men's sizes seem accurate, but women's run small, in my experience.",7
"I love the quality of all three shirts ordered. I���������m kind of hesitant to order clothes online, but I will order aga",7
"I had a problem with one of my shirts, but because of the Christmas crunch, I failed to inform TeePublic until a month later. When they learned of my disappointment, they bent over backwards to make things right.I was impressed with their customer service and very pleased.",7
My daughter was so excited to get this shirt. It is very cute.,7
"I have ordered from this website several times and except for the last time, when I had to check on & follow-up with regard to a prolonged wait time, I have been pleased with the order and the quality of the items received.This last order, however, the quality of two of the shirts was disappointing. - Yellow Stevie Wonder T-Shirt arrived with a visible green ink spot on the front that is not part of the design.- Blue Josie & the Pussycats T-Shirt arrived with a less than pleasing decal on the front. Unsure of why it appears this way but I am afraid to place it in the washer for fear that it will be permanently damaged after one wash.I am really iinterested in how this issue can be addressed and corrected. In the future, please ensure customers the quality they expect & deserve when paying artists & designers for the desired artwork advertised on the website.",7
I would have given it a five except you can't read the black text on the purple shirt and the message is why I bought the shirt. Should have been white text on a dark shirt. I bought a man's small and it looks REALLY small. Will be surprised if it fits.,7
I love my t-shirt! It was delivered quickly and when I contacted TeePublic and communicated that even though I usually wear a sm/med���������the med was surprisingly too small and they sent me a large at no extra cost. Now that���������s goi,7
"Good quality, Fast production, quick delivery !",7
T-shirt is of good quality and it was delivered promptly.,7
"Fast delivery, so happy with the art on the T-shirt, i ordered a size up like was suggested, item still runs very small, but my daughter loved it, it was for her Birthday ����",7
Sizing was a little off for soft ladies XL.,7
So excited for my new Bills shirts! Love them!,7
I like the uniqueness of my purchases. I aspire for individualism and you allow me to achieve it.,7
"Found this company through Facebook Ads and thought to give it a try. The website is hard to navigate to find certain things. The shirt I wanted shown in the Facebook ad was impossible to find on the site and could only view it by opening the ad. I ordered the shirt. Ordering was very simple and easy and I received the shirt in the appropriate time frame. I ordered a 2XL and what I received said 2XL but it was definitely not. Also, the shirt material was very cheap with a very large neck. I was able to contact support and they sent me another shirt and told me to keep or donate the original one so that was cool. The replacement I received fit perfectly and was also a completely different brand of shirt from the first one. So, order if you'd like but be mindful that it may not he exactly what you want but looks like replacing it is a breeze.",7
"It arrived later than expected. It looks great, fits great. My husband loves it. Just wish it had gotten here for Christmas.",7
The shirts came very quickly and are comfy,7
I had an issue with printing & the customer service was so fantastic!!! They got right back to me and assisted with the problem. I had a reprint within a few days and the new ones looked amazing. I even got a follow up email the next day from another employee to make sure everything was taken care of :),7
Perfect. Looked just as advertised. Nice quality.,7
"I ordered several t-shirts but one had an incorrect design. I emailed, got an immediate response, and an expedited replacement. It was fast, easy and much appreciated.",7
"The tee was bought as a present, however, the quality feels good and delivery was very quick",7
Loved the tee shirt.Very happy with the service and to help a small business.,7
quality of the print is very bad. they look blurry.,7
"I ordered T- shirts with my son���������s Magic Company���������s logo.The quality was great, the material was great, the logo was clear and bright. There was an issue with the size of the female shirt ( they run small so order a larger size than your usual).TeePublic quickly and efficiently rectified the",7
Paid $30 for a tee and it showed up with a brown stain on the front of it. Emailed a picture to you guys trying to resolve the issue and got zero responses.,7
Very comfortable t-shirt. Love the design and fast shipping. Perfect pricing. Great company I recommend them for all your shirt needs.,7
The masks were okay- one was printed offset with the text partially blurred. I will never shop at the website again for selling fascist apparel. To claim to represent artists while also profiting off a movement which oppresses those same artists is disgusting and shameless. Your money is stained with blood.,7
I wanted a big baggy t-shirt so I ordered a XL.This shirt is tiny.It���������s snug on my size 6 daughter.Sad to have paid nearly $40 for something,7
AHHH twas great my lad ����,7
Great variety of items. My shirts actually arrived before I expected.,7

Was expecting higher quality products from them since it was rather pricy.,7
This company is on the ball. My Oder wasn���������t cheap to ship but it could have been way worse a few days before Christmas and it arrived right away. I wasn���������t sure it would really arrive and I had days to spare. My sister in law will love the hoodie and I willdefinitely be a repeat c,7

"I was impressed with the quality of this product ! Not at all cheaply made...it arrived earlier then scheduled, so that was a plus. Highly recommend !",7
"I ordered 2 shirts. Both were supposed to be kids size 7. I received a 7 and a 3t. Both shirts are bad quality. They look like they've been sitting around for years. The shirt that is supposed to be white is a yellow tint like it's old. The images are not good quality. For $40, I expected better. Only good thing I can say was customer service was good at handling our exchange of the wrong size shirt.",7
Great value for price. Quality product. Original designs.,7
Fast delivery.AWESOME product!,7
TeePublic has been great to work with. They reached out to me in regard to a color choice that would not work well with the print colors and suggested options. Once I approved the order change the process and fulfillment was seamless and quick.,7
Great shirts! Awesome quality!,7
The shirt ordered for my daughter did not fit.A new one was sent to us free of charge..YOU ARE VERY ACCOMMODATING AND WE APPRECIATE THAT!,7
"For the money (during one of thier nearly constant sales)theyre pretty dang good.Only rated a 4 because of the following:A) any shirt in a heather style of color is reliably 1 size smaller than thier plain color counterparts, so be aware of that. And B) the base shirt quality is kinda mediocre, so you get what you pay for. On the flip side, the designs are always bright and colorful, and they have a wonderful array of artists that sell thru them.",7
Great shirts and lots of designs to choose from. Check the size chart and don't just go with your regular clothing size. I've had to order a size up on what I would usually wear.,7
The t-shirt I bought is beautiful.My husband is going to love it!It arrived within a few days.My overall experience has been great.Thank you!,7
Good choice of good quality tee shirts. Way purchase. Very quick delivery.,7
I ordered 3 Shirts and it took almost a Month to receive them!!!Way too too long!!! Never again!!,7

My sister and I loved our rainbow bright and she ra t shirts.They were so soft and fit well,7
"This review site should clearly show the exact product to be reviewed.I incorrectly rated the ""Warm Hugs"" shirt which would have received 5 stars.The shirt I am rating now is ""Just a woman who loves dogs and Christmas""...I have been pleased with every other order I have placed with Tee Public.This particular design was not set properly and is noticeably off center. I hope this can be corrected.",7
Great products you can't buy elsewhere.High quality.Timely shipping.,7

You went above and beyond when my gifts got lost by the mailing system and sent a new package out.,7

"The customer service is great, they offer a great product and they deliver was amazingly fast. Very happy & will buy from them again",7
"The service was fast and clear. The design was great, the quality of the shirt is poor. I paid extra for the better shirt and its super thin. I know there are similar shirts that have better weight. If the quality of the short was better I would have given 5*. I would even pay a little more for a better quality shirt",7
Ordered a phone case and it came fast. The design was off center and that is the only reasonI am giving it a 4 star. Other than that I really liked the case and design!,7

I like the great prints and shirt colors you offer. I bought a classic tee in orange with ���������Bite Me��������� written in Morse Code. This is probably the 5th shirt I have purchased in the last year where the shirt quality just stinks. Once washed it is all funny shaped and shrinks in all the wrong places. I would buy upgraded T-shirt blends but can���������t say they wer,7

The Tshirts were a gift for my daughter.They were each unique and fun! They were of great quality a well.,7
"The t-shirts are just not good quality. Very weird fit, longer than normal and the material is pretty thin. After just a couple washes lettering is starting to remove on one of the two I ordered. I now feel guilty for buying a shirt from here rather than paying more to get a better quality one from the source of the quote that was on one of the shirts. The other one was unique so I don't mind that. However, with the awkward fit I am not even sure I will keep wearing these. They were supposed to be gym shirts but now they might just be pajama shirts at best.",7
"I pretty much buy all my shirts from TeePublic. Great deals, quality materials, and awesome designs. The one time I ordered the wrong size customer service was on top of it immediately. I've literally recommend them to multiple friends.",7

I found the one that you offered of Frank's standing as a silhouette playing his SG.I liked it so well I decided to get a hoodie with the same logo on it. I am very happy with both the quality and the accuracy of the image. Everywhere I go people ask me, where did you get that wonderful t-shirt? (And what is your favorite album?) The quality and fit was excellent and the way they wash they maintained their color. I am truly happy so I purchased another.",7

I have used TeePublic many times in the past. These designs stand out in a crowd. These are not the average box store patterns. It feels good to not have the shirt 10 other people have.

The shirt is amazing. Everything I hoped for and more. The only thing is I ordered a 2XL but I ended up receiving a 3XL. Which is actually perfect because the material is 100% cotton and will shrink so it actually worked out! I am thrilled.,7
I love all of the options for shirts. They are always quick and well made. I shop from Tee public whenever I need something special.,7

The image of the steelhead is unrecognizable,7
"I'm giving a 5 star rating because I truly love Tee Public! I do I do I do! My purchases so far have been EXCELLENT. My last purchase though, not so sure. I ordered a couple of large buttons and some sweatshirts. The problem was the color display on both items. The color was faint. Not nearly as bold and colorful as displayed when I made the purchase. Honestly, I just don't have the energy to go back and forth so, yeah... I've settled and just kept the items. I know, I know... I was just excited to rock the product. (Shoulder shrug).I just hope my future purchases don't have this same issue. Was never an issue before. Should this occur again, well yeah, I'll definitely return the items in such an instance. Otherwise, TEEPUBLIC IS F****** AWESOME!!!",7

"I bought a couple of shirts & it all arrived on time, fit right, great quality!! But the only problem was the smell of the shirts, they smelled like someone ate salt & vinegar chips and touched the shirts. I had to wash and lightly dry the shirts, and thankfully the smell went away. Definitely gonna order from here again but I would ask if they do something about that vinegar smell on the shirts. I bought more shirts coming soon, and if they smell like vinegar also I will keep this at 4 stars but if it doesn't and that was just a 1 time thing then I will bring it to a 5 star.",7

Ordering was very easy and the shipment came pretty quickly,7
Love this company. I discovered them online 2 years ago looking for a Mammoth Lakes T-Shirt and I found one by a great independent artist. I ended up buying several shirts for myself and my husband. I accidentally bought the wrong size shirts for my husband and the promptly made everything right including sending the replacements bus overnight shipping. Since then I���������m a loyal customer for life. I bought 6 more shots for myself and one as a surprise birthday gift for my husband. As usual all are well designed ,7

The actual graphics on the finished product are not as vibrant or clear as advertised.,7
The sizes were not true to size so I called them to exchange and get the next size up and they told me to keep the tee shirt and sent me the next size which was perfect,7
"Ink and print quality are not great. Most of the shirts in my second order had a misprint where the image looked blurred. However, customer service was great and they organised for me to get the misprinted tees replaced and shipped free. I did have to wait a while though. As to the ink quality, it flakes apart after a couple of months, to the point where you can't clearly see the image, which is a shame because the designs are awesome and deserve a better finish. The fabric is generally pretty thin, especially the 3/4 sleeve shirts. Generally the men's classic tee style is a thicker, better quality fabric than any of the other options. Quality of fabric used for hoodies is great, does not pill, not too thick but still very warm and holds the ink well. The marle-style fabrics unfortunately start to pill after just a few washes, and the paint starts to flake off. The cut of the dolman style women's tee is also quite short and the fabric does shrink quite a bit. I think they could do a better job of showing how the different styles of tees actually look on real people. I guess you get what you pay for though. I really like the designs available through teepublic and overall the tees are okay quality for the price you pay.",7
"Great tees for fair prices, delivered on time and as pictured.",7
I ordered a size large and it didn't fit me. I contacted customer service and got a response that same day telling me they would ship me an xl for free and that I could keep the large to donate. I will definitely be ordering from you again. Amazing customer service!,7

"Ordered 4 shirts total. Two came perfect aside from a strong vinegar smell. One of the others, had a print significantly smaller and of less quality than shown on the site. The other printed well and in the right size, but wasn���������t allowed time to fully dry; so part of the graphic was messed up and stuck to another part. If you���������re spending $20 plus on tee, you���������re probably better off buying an officially licensed one. That way y",7

"Understandably with Christmas ordering and the back up of orders I expected the package to have some delay. It took an entire month to arrive. Luckily the person it was for extended their stay by a few days and it came the day before they left to go back across the country. I would���������ve just paid the extra money to express ship it if I had known, the normal shipping said max 19 days and it took an additional 10 over that. The shirt was great and so was the packaging but the shipping situation was not ideal whatsoever especially when I was prepared and told a completely different amount of time than which it ac",7
"The t-shirt was VERY SOFT. I took off one star because the t-shirt design iron-on was not the highest of quality. It looks like it will wash off quickly and wasn't very thick. If the t-shirt wasn't so soft, I would have returned it.",7
Excellent art And excellent customer service,7
I love all of the designs of the Universal Monsters.I do not think I have ever seen such a large assortment (use to be you could hardly find anything).i find that the stickers are just too small...wish you also had a larger size.They are cool though.The only negative thing I have to say is that the shipping cost for such products is way too high.,7
"I didn't check size charts before ordering a ladies 2XL shirt for my wife. When it arrived, it was way too small. I contacted TeePublic and they replaced the shirt with a men's 2XL shirt that fits my wife perfectly. My initial disappointment was replaced with total satisfaction due to their excellent customer service. The size mistake was mine, but they graciously offered to replace it, no questions asked.",7

I dont where the stock is sent from but. I ordered the shirt for a friend and it arrived quick smart within a few days. I have ordered things here in my own state in nsw BEFORE I ordered the shirt and those other items have still not arrived.

"Ordered a sweatshirt and T shirt from the same artist. Shirt was great, image on the sweatshirt was faded and dull upon delivery. Contacted the company and was told to pick out another design. Biggest problem is, the search function is too vague. I ordered based off of a link that narrowed the results to a certain theme but you cannot search it like that and the results are all over the place. Got tired of trying to search out something specific and just ordered something to fill the order.",7
"I absolutely love my George Floyd shirt but the women's sizes are really small. This is my 2nd try & the return policy is complicated. I gave the 1st one away. It was a 1X. I ordered a 2nd one it is a 2X. Please in plain terms tell me how to exchange or return this new t-shirt. There wss no ticket or receipt included.It is still in the original packageI don't understand these links. Just provide me witha name address and zip, to whose attn, etc.I am going to take my daughter""s advice & geta mens size.ms harris",7
"Excellent transaction. No complaints, was smooth purchasing through the website, and product was as described and of good quality.",7
The fit was good and my friend liked it. ( It was a gift.),7
"I love everything I order from TeePublic. I never wear plain shirts, a part of my signature is having shirts that have words and sayings. All the artists that you feature have some that I love showing off and it just fits me. I love TeePublic!!!!",7
"Shirts are great, but depending on the artist/process, some fade pretty quickly while others the ink doesn't seem fully cured. But, overall great shirts!!",7
The product was done perfectly. It was quality materialthat they used to make my shirts.,7
Great communication and on time delivery. Had a bit of a hiccup with a wrong colored t-shirt being sent but was fixed and shipped immediately. Can't ask for better service. Highly recommend!,7
Prompt delivery and the t- shirt came out great!,7
"Buying was easy, I was immediately sent email updates and was able to track it the whole time without any problems.",7

The shirt came quickly and is great quality,7
"Awesome designs, great quality, fair price, fast shipping! What's not to love?",7
"Timely shipping, good communication.",7
The design is really good but the quality of the print did not transfer well with the art's details. I dont know if I got a bad print or if it's like that always.,7
Never got my package and customer service is useless. Five different people emailed me after I inquired about my missing package. They don't have a number you can call. 6-8 days for my order but am being told I have to wait until the 29th to request a refund. Was told that currier's can scan it as delivered before delivering it which is crap. Noone does that. I don't recommend using this site. They rip you off and it's all third party bullcrap.,7
"I have purchased three crewneck sweatshirts (size: S): one fits me perfectly well, another a little tight, and the other a little too tight. There is ""size & fit info"" but the one you receive may be much smaller than what the info says.",7
TeePublic is all over their stuff!They keep you aware of where your order is and they do what they say their going to do.,7
Quick turnaround. Both shirts look great. Not using stiff/itchy t-shirts but quality soft shirts.,7
"I want to start with a positive and the reason behind my 2 stars --the art you have for shirts and more is amazing!However the printing quality to those shirts is something I honestly feel I could accomplish with my printer from home. I was excited when the arrived, I knew my daughter was going to love hers as well but when I unwrapped them I was shocked by the quality. It looks like a iron on photo transfer that with a couple of washes will be destroyed. For what feels like a popular, big name tee company I'll be honest I won't be ordering again any time soon.",7
"Loved my purchase,loved the guick delivery also. I will continue to order from this site.",7
"The design was nice, but the material is SO thin. When I held it up I could see through the fabric and my shirt smelled so bad when I opened the package.",7

The most amazing products and amazing return policies ever!!,7
"I ordered a couple of shirts. When they arrived, I received two completely random shirts. I didn't recognize anything about them, wrong size and all. I contacted Tee public help line and they were very helpful and very responsive. Got the correct shirts in a couple of weeks",7

Great service! The amount of designs are amazing.,7

"TeePublic has amazing customer service. I ordered a shirt for a friend as a gift, and I guessed the wrong size. I emailed the company and had a response with a few days and an email a day later saying my new order was being processed. There was no additional charge, and they let me keep the one that was the wrong size. The quality of the design and the material of the shirt are very nice. I am super happy with my purchase and the care I received from customer service. I will definitely order from them in the future!",7
Very Satisfied.... my daughter love her sweater,7
"Reps were very friendly, courteous, and fast to reply.",7
Great quality and delivery. Will buy many more from them.,7
When I tracked my package saying it was delivered to another location I contacted TeePublic.They looked into it immediately and even processed a rush order.The next mail date I received my shirts despite the delivery history still saying it was across the country. I contacted TeePublic to cancel the rush order. Shirts are exactly what I hoped and customer service is top notch from start to finish.,7
Excellent! Got exactly what I ordered and even got here early ����,7
Great!!! Got my order fast!!,7
The color of the print on the dark color of the shirt barely shows up and when it was shown on the website it looked as though the writing would be in a lighter color so it would be able to be shown easily.,7
Easy site to use and search. Fast shipping and turn around.,7
Easy to navigate websiteSuper fast deliveryAnd took care of a small discrepancy I had instantly without hassleHighly recommend,7
Such an awesome tee! I have spoken,7
"I ordered a hoodie for my son, but it was too small for him. I emailed and asked about exchanging it for a larger size. I received a message that same day that they would send me a larger size and instead of sending it back to them, to either keep, donate it or reuse it. I was impressed at how fast they got back to me, the best customer service. I plan on purchasing more items from these guys! Plus the packaging it was delivered in was awesome!",7

Great customer service. I ordered a women's large relaxed fit tee shirt which turned out fitting like a medium. Wanted to exchange it for a extra-large. They sent me a replacement and told me to keep or donate the first one to someone.,7
"The website was very easy to use, and the shipping cost and time was reasonable. The t-shirt print was also far better than expected.",7
"items were prepared and mailed very quickly.The quality of the T-Shirt was very good, the applique was not a heavy thick unmoving applique that is stiff and uncomfortable to wear",7

"They have a lot of great designs. They've improved the search function on the site which helps a lot. My only partial complaint is the overall price with shipping. I'd buy a whole bunch if I could get a discount. Also, the design starts to break a part after around a year of regular washing. That's really not bad. Overall, they have a great product and a great ability to customize color, size and shirt type. I would definitely recommend them.",7
"Great graphics, great fit, great shirts! Timely shipping. Highly satisfied.",7

"I love the products, the price was absolutely fine and the Shirts arrived super fast. This was definetly not my last order!",7
"Overall, I am extremely happy with TeePublic. Their website is easy to navigate, their designs are very cool, and their customer service is stellar. In the past I have always purchased from Redbubble, but I decided to give TeePublic a try and I am glad I did. Their ""default"" (the Classic) tees are kind of thin and far more ""fitted"" than I like, but that is about the only issue I had. The Heavyweight tee is awesome. I like that they are longer than the tees at Redbubble and the cotton they make the shirts out of are super soft and comfortable. So, if you are a bigger guy like me and you like thicker boxier tees, go with the heavyweight. I will definitely be buying all my tees from TeePublic in the future. You should too!",7
The Straight Chilling merch is awesome! Excellent quality and well worth the price!,7
"They had good customer service since they replaced immediately the first shipping that arrived with some defects.However, I would like to point out the excessive amount of paper that comes in every package, with two unnecessary copies of the shipping address, among more paper waste.",7

Never had a bad experience with these folks,7
"I feel...conflicted... The buying process was great, the shirt came quickly and I feel like the site is a great one. Love all of the choices and might order again. The site is super easy to use and the amazing artists give so many great choices. However, not overly happy with my soft long sleeve women's tee purchase. When it came, it wasn't soft at all and it wasn't a tee!!!The neckline is so big, it reminds me of Flashdance from the 80's. It has a weird,open weave texture that is going to lead to shrinkage when i wash it.I adore the artwork and it is so cute... But the major texture on the tee has made it look fuzzy. It was supposed to look distressed and that is fine, but it's just messy looking. ( In full disclosure, I spent 13 years reviewing artwork and screen prints for a major children's clothing company.) I might order again, but not this style. I didn't feel the cost was worth it for this top. It wasn't a tee at all and the neckline is awful. Next time I would stick with plain ol short sleeve tee with art and see if it works out better.",7
"product quality was sub-par.Just looks cheap, like it was done at someone's kitchen table.It was an inexpensive product so no big deal, but I would not buy from this person/artist/company again.Shipping and delivery took way way longer that i expected.Especially for the cost of shipping a small little button (shipping was more than twice the cost of the button itself).",7
I have no complaints- smooth process.,7

Great T-shirt designs. Super quick delivery and design was as expected. Definitely would buy again! ��������,7
Love the design varietiesand different shirts selections. My only concern was some of the logos or designs were not centered and a little off like someone didn't take there time. Love Everything Else.,7
I ordered a XXL but I normally wear a XL T-Shirt that shirt is so tight. I also ordered a face mask to match the t-shirt and it was not included in my order.I was very excited about turning 50 but this order has made me sad.,7
Got my order quickly and was pleasantly surprised with the quality,7
I ordered the heavyweight t shirts and they were just what I expected. A nice tough t shirt. Good fit.,7

Emailed them and heard back very quickly asking for pictures, which I sent back straight away. A couple hours later, they were handling the reshipment of the shirt.

I purchased 4 T-shirts from TeePublic and one of those tees had a blurry picture on it. I informed them about the situation and they quickly resolved the issue. I would definitely recommend because the quality was great and shipping time was very fast.,7
I had a great experience with TeePublic! The first shirt I ordered ended up being smaller than expected but their customer service was wonderful at helping me resolve the issue. They responded to my email in less than a day and offered to reprint my shirt on a new size and ship it free of charge. Very pleased with the service!,7

Great job thank,7
"The search engine for TeePublic is utterly worthless. It barely even responds to specific searches. I also always know I'm going to have to get my shirts reprinted, because they consistently print the logos too low on the shirts. And even the reprints are usually wrong again too. I will never shop TeePublic again",7
The shirt felt fairly durable for the price. It looked even better in person than it did on the internet (which is unusual) Im very happy with my shirt. It looks fantastic!,7

Order came in before time and looks amazing. There was a little damage on the side of my notebook but nothing to get up in arms about. Will definitely order here again.,7
Non/slow responsiveness and don't honor commitments. That's the main reason they got rid of telephone customer service so they could ignore customers and respond if and when they want. Buy from another vendor.,7
Ordered two of the Calvin and Hobbes masks. Both the images were subpar and looked more like something you might receive from wish. Have ordered other things without and issue so maybe masks aren��������,7

"Great quality t shirts, will be buying again!",7
"I bought a 2t George Strait shirt and opted for the premium one. The shirt isn���������t any softer or better than a regular shirt so I would say don���������t spend that extra buck! As for the shirts itself, in the picture on the website it looks like the design is much bigger than it actually is. The screen print is very small and you can barely tell who it is. Not very happy about that at all. Won�����",7
The ability to customize shirts and have them say what I want. Fast delivery and great service.,7
Tanks fit great and feel good. Only issue was one of the tank designs was not centered correctly inn the middle of the shirt.,7
Item arrived quickly. Very cute tank.,7
The shipping super fast and sizing really accurate,7
Good price and fit,7
"I ordered two XXL ""regular"" style t-shirts. One of them is a decent weight Gilden shirt that is true-to-size though the design was applied slightly crooked. The second shirt is a paper thin no-name shirt that is almost 2"" smaller. And, on top of that, the design was applied both very off-centered and crooked and there are two odd water spot type irregularities at the top of the design. How was this shirt ever sent out? I just read the return instructions and see I have to jump through hoops with photos to make a return on a defective item. Great.",7
Product delivered quickly.T shirt was well made and the design was perfect.,7
I have bought from this website 3 times. The T-shirts have all been fabulous! Great quality shirtsand graphics are done well. Will continue to buy from this site. Highly recommend!!,7

The problem I have is not with the product.I paid for expedited shipping because the website guaranteed before Christmas.It is now 9:47pm on December 24th and part of my order has still not been delivered.,7

"Brilliant artwork at a low price, there's no better way to nerd out.",7
"I wanted to order a Field of Dreams t-shirt that had the quote ""If you build it he will come"". Your website listed the t-shirt with that quote. When the t-shirtcame a week late it had the incorrect word - ""If you built it he will come"".Everyone in the world knows the correct quote.Get your web page act together properly!!!!!Also, I do not accept the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy because it is not provided on the response page.",7

Great designs. Love the quality.,7
"Creative Designs, Fair Price, Great Service!! :)",7
I love my shirt. It got here fast and its exactly what I wanted,7
"Bought masks that don't fit. They are formless and do not fit on a face well. Measurements are OK (I can handle making sure the dimensions would fit) but the fit is formless and bad. You could improve by adding a metal nosepiece to make a secure fit. My boyfriend says the masks look like little boys underwear on the face and, well, they do. Not satisfied and it was a waste of money. This does not reflect on the artists, their art is beautiful, the masks are just poorly designed.",7
Takes too long to get product. Ordered similar products from Amazon and got it in two days. This took way too long,7
"I love the designs and SO many options, but it would be really nice if you could filter your results more.The search doesn't seem to be very good.Keep the sales going and I will be back!",7
I love the masks that I bought I'm from California if I live in Georgia and I love if things with my home state,7
The tee shirt arrived quickly. It is well made. Just as pictured.,7
I received my order way before the expected delivery date and the shirt and hoodie are great quality.,7
"Great communication, fast shipping.",7
I ordered a royal blue with black script. You can hardly see the script. Not really thrilled with end results.,7
I appreciate the updates throughout the shipping process.,7
"I have been shopping on TeePublic for the past four years and have been nothing but satisfied with both their offerings and the user interface. It's easy to search, easy to buy and I love the fact that it will remind me about sales (such as ""add two more stickers for 20% off"").This has, in all honesty, become one of my top 2 stops for online shopping for shirts and stickers.",7
Fits true to size. I wear a medium so i ordered a large just in case but it came out pretty big for me. That was my fault so the next shirt i purchase im going with a medium. Excellent quality as well������������,7
Product as described.Came as I thought it would when I tought it would,7
Loved the t-shirt I bought......size was perfect!,7
My son loves the Boyz to Men t-shirt I ordered from Tee public! Great graphics and nice quality shirt#,7
Great tee shirts! Were as advertised I'm very happy with my order.,7
"My orders didn't arrive after a month. They had to ask three seperate times for me to choose a different shirt colour. I eventually asked for a refund. Customer service was swift, helpful and reimbursed me almost right away. I will probably try and order from here again since I trust the customer service.",7
Easy to deal with. Great selection of prints.,7
The graphics are nice but the shirts run very very small.I can't even get it on. Alot of money and can't even wear it.����,7
"Quick delivery, quality t shirt, good support of individual artists. Makes me want to become a contributor.",7
Material quality is terrible. Not sure if every shirt is the same or not but very unsatisfied with my purchase. My purchase was a Xmas gift so a exchange or return in time was not a option,7
The prints color is a little dull and it loses a lot of detail. The shirt i got was perfectly fine so i think its to do with the hoodie material more than anything,7
Shirt designs washed right off in the first wash,7
Replacement shirts to correct a size issue are great!,7
Was a gift an nephews loved it,7
It came perfectly on time and looks amazing!It's the perfect size I wanted and so comfy!The design is also so cute!,7
Showed up ontime and the product is quality material. I was impressed,7
"Ordered 4 shirts for the family. 3/4 turned out well.The one shirt was red and the white screen printing came out pink.Surprisingly,the red ink also looked dark pink.Completely ruined the shirt. Wish the quality control was better",7
Wonderful product and fast delivery services,7
"The items I ordered were fine.They were only $13 each so I wasn't expecting much.But the same shirt is different colors were DIFFERENT sizes.I could wear the white one, but not the navy one.",7
Easy purchase and quick delivery.,7
Fast shipping ! Great product ! Just as described.I got a gift for Christmas for my mom and she���������,7
Love the tee shirt I bought for my daughter and some awesome stickers ����,7
Really happy with my merchandise.Good quality work. My grandchildren love it. I would recommend you to friends,7
The shirt I got had a strange saying? It is being replaced with another shirt free of charge.,7
"Thus far, I've ordered two items: a Tee Shirt & a novelty Button. I've exceptionally please with both and find the quality for each to be superior. If anything, I'd suggest working on the length of time it takes until they arrive, but this is a very small criticism (Now that they have arrived, I very pleased!)",7
"Great shirt, site was easy to use and shipping was fast.",7
Love my new shirt.Good quality and my order was correct.,7
Shirt designs are unique and colorful! Spouse loved the shirts.,7
"Great company and awesome the fact you support artists, but sometimes price is a little high but usually wait for a sale since the designs always stay there.",7
"I ordered two long sleeved graphic tees. The designs on both were very good. However, one of the shirts was not good quality. The material was cheap and the sleeves were way too long. You could just tell it was a cheap shirt..too bad cause the graphic design is great. The other shirt was a much better quality and I'm totally satisfied with it. Also they shipped very quickly. Loved that. Bottom line. I would have rated this a 5 star. But 1 out of two needs improvement.",7
"Your website didn���������t work. Your managers and staffwould not acknowledge it, or take action to rectify it. They blamed PayPal and in actuality everything on the PayPal side worked correctly. They did not offer to help or assist with the order. The response from your manager was smug and condescending.I can buy T-shirt's in a lot of other places and will choose do that for future purchases. Hope this business model is working out for you and you are achieving your EBITDA goals in these uncertain times",7
"The tees are very nice! The only reason it isn't 5 stars is that 2 of the tees came printed on the incorrect shirts, but the customer service was very helpful and responsive so they made it right.",7
"Great, fun shirts!",7
"Nice product but small for adult for XL size, it fits my 6 years old even if it���������s for woman but the shipment would have have gone faster it took a while to get here and I thought it would never get here but it finally here, so I��������",7
The printing is high quality and t-shirts are soft.,7
"I love the variety of tshirts you offer. There is something for everyone!! Be it an oldie but goodie cartoon, a classic tv show you wish was still on, or funny one liners to make someone laugh. The shirt colors are great. There are stickers too. I wish they were a little bigger but hey, they're still cool!! Thank you.",7
"Ordered 4 shirts. Three were fine. But the fourth, which is for my special needs son, was wrong style (sleeveless vs kids T-shirt), wrong size (adult vs kids) and wrong color (black vs royal blue). Messaged for an exchange two days ago and have heard nothing back.",7
"Prints look great, sizes fit well",7
"Amazing company have never been disappointed. All shirts are amazing, comfortable, fit well, and all exchanges go well even for something as simple as a more comfortable fit!",7
Image is blurry and not very good quality all around. Sad face.,7
I loved how many different items I could choose from and the shipping was very accurate and fast!,7
My experience was amazing!I ordered a teeshirt that was the wrong size. I sent an e-mail and had a response the next day. A new shirt was sent and I was advised to keep or donate the original shirt. How is that for satisfaction guaranteed!,7
VERY satisfied with my purchase! The T-shirt was very good quality & came in a very timely manner. I will definitely be ordering from them often!Gwen Davis/UT,7
Good stuff. Great customer service.,7
"Always great service, different and very cool graphics",7
"So I got my SECOND shirt in the mail. The logo was printed about 20% bigger than the old one and the colors were off.What happened to quality control? All you sell is t-shirts. You can't even get your own product right!?Will NEVER order from this place again.Inks were not true to color on website. Now I can maybe forgive this because the color of the tshirt can sometimes have an effect on the saturation.But what I can't get over was the image was centered in EXACTLY the middle of the t shirt (which looks dumb and amateur.) Every t-shirt I've ever purchased with a logo or design on it is always printed more toward the top. In fact I measured the logo on 3 different t-shirts I had. The top of each logo was 3"" below the neckline on all the tshirts. It's a standard printing practice.",7
"The logo was very accurate but much larger than it appears on the site. Also, the tee-shirt fabric is quite thin. Will wear it anyway since I love Colegio.",7
Good quality. Right size. One shirt design had more blue than I expected. But still love the selection that Tee Public offers.,7
This tshirt was of low grade material and the logo was barely visible.,7
There I a white line going across the shirt???,7
"I opted for a premium t shirt, paid almost ������30 for it and the quality is shocking!! The material is very thin and flimsy. NOT a premium T-shirt that���������s for sure!! I emailed ",7
The shirt is so cute and it came rather quickly compared to other shippers.,7
I was looking for ideas for my veterinary staff for appreciation. I was blown away with all the selections. I received the shipment fast for how much I ordered. I was impressed and my staff loved this gifts!,7
Great quality of product and super fast delivery!,7
Supreme Product! Magnificent! Magnificent!,7
This hoodie is so soft and warm. The fit is great. And the design looks perfect.,7
I get so many compliments whenever I wear your shirts. Love everything about your products.,7
Unique gifts & good quality,7
Had a size issue with 2 women's shirts. They run real small. Teepublic was kind enough to instantly ship out new sizes and did not want us to return the other shirts. Hands down great service,7
Problem free transaction and great t shirts!,7
I love the shirt. I just feel it took forever to get here.,7
"The prices are great but there's some things that can be worked on with having a live person to talk to with questions and order issues. Also with shipping,when it states 7-12 business days it should take 22-23 days. But on the flip side through an email complaint on this issue it was unexpected, but they resolve my issue in a way I wasn't requesting or expecting... They refunded some of the money",7
I ordered the wrong size.I reached out to customer service and heard back in a timely manner.I received my new shirt and am 100% satisfied.I would definitely use them again.,7
"As of today (Jan. 1, 2021) I have not received 1 of the 2 items that was ordered on Dec.6, 2020. The sweatshirt seems to be a item of good quality. I cannot comment on the tee-shirt at this time due to the fact that I do not have it yet.This delay in receipt of the tee-shirt is no way the fault of the vendor. Teepublic processed the order quickly but the USPS has failed to do their job as of nearly4 weeks later.I would suggest that the vendor start to use UPS or FEDEX for shipping being that the USPS cannot be trusted.To me the small extra charge for shipping I would have to pay would be worth it and may go a long way to improve customer satisfaction.",7
"I don���������t order often, but when I do they always have what I need! Prices are reasonably priced and the products are well made.",7
"I ordered 4 shirts, but when they were shipped, the order only had 3 shirts.Seems there is an issue with the ordering process.So now I had to reorder one of the shirts and hoping I get it in time.",7
"Great communication , fast delivery.",7
"I bought the ���������upgraded tee��������� and the quality is very thin, I���������d hate to see the normal tee. Also, using their size chart a XL should have been plenty, it arrive and is very untrue to size. Maybe in between a medium and large. I have to assume they selected a large but I can���������t tell as there is no label on it.UPDATE: I originally gave TeePublic 2 stars but after seeing my review, I was contacted and they took care of the issue right ",7
"Great quality! Perfect fit. And of all my online orders during the pandemic, it was processed and arrived in a timely manner.",7
Great products and speedy service and delivery.,7
It's very nice shirt I wasn't expecting it to be here in less then two days that's a huge plus. The shirt itself felt very nice and fit without a problem at all I'm gonna be ordering from here when I want to get all kinds of shirts.,7
Shipping was fast and the communication was really good ����,7
Had an issue with a size I ordered. Customer service was amazing and quickly corrected the issue.,7
I ordered the t shirt extra size larger.It still ran small.Besides that everything else was good.She well have to wear it only in the house because it is to small.She was disappointed.,7
"Repeat customer.They have unique designs that are (often) offered on shirts, cups, stickers and magnets.Orders are tracked and arrive in a reasonable time frame.Customer service is responsive via email.Merchandise is good quality.Would easily recommend doing business with them.",7
Longer than expected shipping. At first wrong shipping information was sent. Then I was told it was delayed and different shipping information was sent.,7
Got the t shirt for my 16 yr. old son. He loved it. If him just right.,7
The shirt and tote designed by Nick Maskell was delivered when they said it would be. Both items were perfect.,7
"easy to use and order. well informed about prices, tracking and delivery. great prices and fabric quality.would reccomend.",7
I love all the tees I received. Got them in a timely manner.,7
"The shirt I ordered arrived in a timely manner, and it looked great and fit well.",7
"I ordered 1 Shirt and 1 magnetic badge (Maranax Infirmux), they are both much too thin, also the badge Looks more like a sticker, so overall i am not really happy with the quality and i wouldn't order again.",7
"The quality of the product is good. But the I waited for too long. , incredibly too long to receive my order. And even after it was shipped, it took forever to receive.",7
Seemingly limitless selection of designs to choose from printed well and on quality shirts!!,7
The tshirt is great but sizing is way off.I ordered an XL based on the recommendation to order 1-2 sizes bigger than your usual size.It fits like a medium.It���������s cotton so it will likely shrink to be a size small.I����,7
Good customer service! I Recommend,7
"The size I ordered was too small, so Tee Public sent me a new order, one size up, and I donated the smaller size as they requested.",7
"The shirt is cute. the first one was too small. another was sent, but delivered to someone else so, I never received it. Not certain where it is. But I don't have it. Anyway, I bought another from amazon that is similar. Thanks for great customer service and speedy delivery, too bad The replacement is lost/stolen.",7
"Second time buying shirts from Teepublic, I really like the quality and designs. Keep up the awesome work!",7
"Great selection, great service!",7
"Great selection and unique. Didn't see these anywhere else. Took a little while to get, so plan ahead, but worth it.",7
With how the shipping complications are right now - you guys were ready able to come through on resending a couple of my orders due to the ordered being not received and resending the orders after me reaching out about it.,7
"Items were ordered, ""shipped"" and never received. Had to ask for items to be reshipped and even then they showed much later than originally planned.",7

"3/4 items I ordered were good, however one of the items had a color screen printing error. TeePublic did a great job of replacing the shirt, however the replacement shirt had a different printing error. The other items were good, and they have nice customer service, but we gave up trying to get the replacement shirt replaced and we are living with it. The shirts were on the thin side, but happy to support independent artists.",7

The amazing fathers day designs made it easy to pick out two of these for my partner (with the kids' input on colour choices). Checkout was easy and the shirts arrived in time for fathers day even though I was a bit last minute with my order.They were well received and are in high rotation already ����,7
The quality of the item (a Gildan brand sweatshirt) was mediocre for the cost.,7
The shirt was nice but there were splatters of ink at the top of the shirt near the collar. Not a clean finish.,7
"The shade of black was not the one advertised, but other than that pretty nice fit and great quality.",7
Loved the cute t shirts. I would have liked to have been able to get both the men's and women's in the same color.,7

My granddaughter loved it ! Great quality and done really nice! She was surprised. Thank you!,7
Absolutely perfect! The shirts are great! Just like I expected!,7

The products are top notch and I have never had a wrong order,7
Had an issue with print on T=shirt and it was fixed right away. Way to go!,7

"I ordered this t-shirt from you guys once before. I ordered two but I got one. I couldn't be sure if I hadn't made a mistake, so I ordered two T-shirts again and I got one again. This is really too bad because both times I paid for two T-shirts. It sucks because these are great shirts.edit: okay, so the folks got with me and made everything right. It turns out that every time I change the quantity from one to two, some sort of glitch changed it back from two to one. They're looking into it. And I really appreciate their help. Thank you T public!",7

"I paid the expedited fee to get a shirt delivered in time for an event. It sat in a warehouse for an extra couple days & ended up delivering 2 days after it was needed. I received half of the shipping charge back, but that was of little consequence. I understand I could've ordered earlier, I understand delays during a pandemic, but the expedited info shouldn't be available if expedited delivery can't happen.",7

I had three people respond to me, very nearly after I sent a message about my strife to begin with. They were curtious & very helpful. This is a great company with great people work for them!

"Use a different delivery service. This was ordered as part of a Halloween costume. Was purchased on 10/19, and with 6-8 business days to process, it was expected well before Halloween. I got no notification it shipped, but when I checked the status on 10/25, it said it was on its way. It sat with Mail Innovations in lake stevens (where I live) from 10/24 to 11/4 when it was finally delivered. This was beyond ridiculous. Out of control of tee public, aside from the fact that you as a company could have chosen a different more reliable carrier like UPS. My daughter does love the shirt now that she has it, but was irritated she needed to figure out a new costume the day before her party when we finally gave up on this item.",7

The shirts are perfect. They are a great fit and print.They were gifts for my son and husband for Christmas.I didn't receive them until after christmas but realize it was USPS fault.,7
Tee public is fabulous.No problems ever.,7
I love the shirt. The only problem is that I wish the design was printed larger on my shirt,7
"I ordered the premium shirt and it was just a basic Next Level Try-Blend. They didn't do a very good job of conveying that. The print is nice and the shirt is fine, but I wouldn't have spent the extra if I knew that was the shirt they'd use. Probably won't be back.",7
"Terrible communication. Should not offer expedited shipping because of Covid there are mail delays. I ordered a mask for a bday gift, it came late and was damaged. Because they have no phone number, you can���������t reach them easily. They are slow to respond to emails. I would definitely not recommend them. I did finally hear from them about a replacement. But they are poor at ans",7
"I brought two items for my fianc������ to surprise him. He loves the Green Power Ranger so I got him a shirt and a phone case, but I ordered the wrong case for his phone. Sent an email and got a response within 24 hours. Very very helpful with the entire process! Tha",7
The shirt is way to thin its something you could find at a dollar storenot happy with the quality of the image its has small lines form when they printed it I assumewould never suggest this site to anyone,7
"Womens shirt was pretty small, but website did warn about the sizing for this shirt.",7
I ordered my shirt to wear to a lee brice concert. I noticed the R in brice doesn't really look like an R. I won't wear it to the concert but I like the shirt and will wear it for every day wear. Overall I'm satisfied.,7

My Daughter loves the shirt!!! Great quality.,7

Quick.Easy. As ND a variety of choices,7
I never received my product and have been emailing back and forth for a week now just trying to get a refund,7

"Loved the shirt, my grandson will really enjoy it.",7
Great selection of items.Easy purchase-items were exactly as promised.Would shop again,7
"Ordered 3 t-shirts. 2 of the 3 didn't fit because of the style. Teepublic fixed the issue and replaced the 2 that didn't fit free of charge! Didn't even have to return them. How amazing! Better yet, they tell you to donate or repurpose. The shirts are of good quality and they have amazing customer service. Will absolutely order again.",7
"I ordered mine to come in ASAP and it delivered very quickly, I love what I got and enjoy the view everyday",7
I got the refund for the shirt with less than satisfactory design print.,7
"The men's shirts are great but the women's are not true to size.I ordered XLs because I like wearing my tank tops a bit loose but the XLs are tiny.So much smaller than the men's L.If you are super tall and/or just have a bigger frame beware, the women's sizes run Super small.",7
Great product and terrific costumer service!!!,7
"I absolutely love the concept and execution of this site. From the amazing design to the available options for products, I enjoyed the format of the site. I���������ve already placed another order and will likely be doing some Christmas shopping here in ",7
The design was fantastic and looked exactly like the picture online. I ordered an adult XL and the shirt I received would fit a child.,7
The design was exactly what I was expecting and the delivery was sooner than expected which was great as I had it for Christmas when originally I didn't think it would be in by then.,7
"Shipping was prompt and the design is good, though I thought the red car would be a bit brighter. The fabric quality looks great, but at 100% cotton, which feels nice to wear, it will no doubt shrink when being dried...no washing instructions included. I'm worried that the Large shirt is a bit small for a man's large. It's only 21.5"" wide, 43 around. After drying in a dryer, it will most likely fit like a Medium sized shirt.",7
"Great shirts, fast shipping, gees prices! I��������",7
The size and quality were great!The saying on the front fit my husband perfectly!,7
"Great shirt well made, very happy with it.",7
"This isn't the first time I've ordered from your company. I've always had a good experience until this order. The small mans size tshirt looked like it was made for a small female and the womens plus size shirt wasn't near the size it should have been. Also, I placed the order in plenty of time to get here by Christmas. It didn't arrive until after Christmas. I hope your company gets the kinks worked out soon because I spent $92.00 on this order.",7

"I ordered 2 adult shirts and 2 youth shirts. The designs were great. The colors of the adult shirts were great.The color of one the youth shirts is terrible. I order white (white and green were the only 2 options in youth size, for this particular design). Its a very dingy dirty white. I'm going to try and dye it a different color. The other youth shirt was gray - that color was fine.",7

"I bought a Soft Tee shirt with a picture of Owlette, on it.They recommended to buy a size larger, I'm glad I did. Everything about this tee shirt was perfect. They are a bit pricey, but it was well worth it to see a smile on my Grandson's face when I wear it.",7
Amazing customer service and love the products!!!!! 10/10!,7

I have every intention of getting more top quality wear from this artist.,7
Quality of shirt was less than expected for the cost!,7
"Shipment that never arrived was really promptly handled by two very responsive ladies.Adress was re-confirmed, shipping method was changed (with no additionnal costs), item was re-shipped and delivered few days later. This while I'm quite sure that the Shipment rather than TeePublic was at the cause of the missing order. I think I can sincerely say this was the best online help I was ever offered!",7
"Decent shirt - and price.Fairly quick shipping.However, there is a small hole in the front of the shirt.Now I can not give it as the gift it was intended to be.",7
"Still waiting for an order placed 11/21, and it is 12/26.So much for the Christmas gift.Tracking says in transit.Never again.Will cancel charge, if shirt does not arrive within the week.",7
Fantastic services and beautiful designs.,7
"I've ordered a number of items in recent years from TeePublic. It's always a good experience. Great stuff, great customer service!",7
I had a sizing issue and they took care of it immediately and made it right. I do believe they need to adjust their sizing guides for the women sizes but besides that the whole experience was great. I also love the tees I got! Will definitely order from them again,7
The hoodie was too small and Alexandra was quick to send the correct size. Excellent customer service!,7
As advertised. Great art and quality print. Consider sizing UP.,7
I can not say enough good about Teepublic! We made a purchase in December and the print did not hold up it was defective I assume and I emailed in March to inquire about it. They emailed back within 24 hours and offered to replace it for free! I was not expecting that at all. They even sent follow up emails throughout the process!They are truly an amazing company and stand by their product quality! We will be busting again in the future!,7
I received it fast. But quality is poop.,7
Amazing quality for a fantastic price. How do you ship so fast?,7
It got here right on time and the color was perfect. The logo was distressed but was slightly faded into the color of the t-shirt(if that makes sense. The real down side was the quality of the t-shirt alone. It was extremely thin and not worth the high price.,7
Loved the t-shirts and service. Definitely buy more,7
Great experience.Just wish they offered XLT size,7
"I almost never complete these surveys, but when I got this one I thought about it for a minute or two and realized that I couldn't think of anything bad to say about my experience with TeePublic which is unusual these days. It was easy, it was efficient, I like the product and the price, and I will use them again. Got to be 5 stars right?",7
"I love the shirt, however the medium size seems too small.I am hoping that it won't shrink once my daughter washes it.",7
Ease of ordering is great. Prices are competitive. The shirt quality is not as expected and the sizes seem to run very small.,7
Fast shipping great product,7
Awesome company. Cool shirts and great customer service.,7
Quality of the print on the teez is honestly terrible. Not sure how they're printed but they look cheap. Not great for an Xmas gift but oh well.,7

"I was SO excited for this!!! Literally raved about Teepublic to every one because I absolutely love the fact that they support the artist! But my package I got was so horrid. Online it was beautiful, titled ���������the great wave��������� by Susanne Buchanan. I ordered an XL black hoodie and when I opened my package the ���������black��������� hoodie was more like charcoal and the picture/logo was/is sooo faded. The colors are NOT vibrant and the design looks ���������stretched��������� as if originally the logo was smaller and they just blew it up to look like a decent size on a sweatshirt. I spent near $50 on a damn sweatshirt and can���������t get my money back. This WAS supposed to be a very sentimental gift for my boyfriend this Christma",7
The shirt is very soft but the actual print is so blurring and not focus and no color,7

Ordered the 9th with ���������guaranteed Christmas delivery���������. Have not seen it as yet. UPS has the lousiest tracking on the net.

"Ordered my tee shirt, it arrived, it looked just as expected!!",7
I prefer not to shop online because you do not know if you can trust the companies. I took a chance an placed an order with TeePublic. I purchased three items in May an have only received one it is now June 16th. TeePublic made sure to take full payment for all items. The problem with online shopping is the customer does not have any recourse. I was not provided a customer service phone number to follow up with my order. This is a classic case of live and learn. I will avoid online shopping in the future.,7
"Got my shirt, looks just like the picture.The tshirt is a little thin but that's fine.",7
"The system is there for content to easily be old, now it just needs a means for sellers and customers to organize and communicate on-site. There is currently no purchase history, making it a few extra steps to find prior storefronts, as an example. That and other quality of life changes will make this a powerhouse.",7
Super bright colors!!! Love it! ����,7

Good quality and prices. Trustworthy.,7
I'm glad I got them on sale. $20 is a bit steep. But they do have a good selection. But the shirts were not special beyond that.,7
"I really like this site, it has been a huge help in getting my ideas out there, but I feel the designplatform could be made better such as allowing more of the shirt to be printed, like the shoulders and stuff. Otherwise you guys do a fantastic job, your customer service is quick and good, for the most part I'm satisfied thank you!",7
"Great sale, great customer service.",7
The timing of shipment & delivery were very good,7

Everything was fine when I opened the box, nothing broken or damadged. I will be coming back for more!",7

"Great product, as described. Fast delivery.",7
Awesome design!,7
"The ONLY reason I am giving 4 stars is because of the exceptional customer service! The sweatshirt I ordered had cracks and drips in the screen print, you could literally wipe chunks off! A new one was supposed to be sent, I thought it was a joke when I received a sponge Bob Christmas tee-shirt, instead of the F Biden sweatshirt I was supposed to get! Money refunded immediately after the 2nd attempt! Very good customer service, greatly appreciated!",7
"I like the product but,I wish the shipping was free or cheaper. For one tee shirt that started out reasonably priced, the added shipping costs,kind of dampened my spirits towards multiple purchases.",7

My family ordered t-shirts for our vacation.We ordered them 6 weeks early.My shirts took the entire 6 weeks to get here!They came the day before we left for our trip!My daughters order had one shirt arrive that was the wrong size and another shirt that was a random white shirt with fairies on it!My other daughter got a shirt that was the wrong size also!,7

"Found exactly what I wanted, lots to choose from, perfect color. Shipping options too. Great!!",7
"Cute shirt, too small. A large is not a true large",7
The tee's were shipped quickly but they were very small.Luckily I ordered these for 11 year old girls but it will barely fit them.plus they are of a quality that will shrink.,7
Great shirts quick shipping. Definitely will continue to do business with them!!!,7
Shirt is awesome will order again!,7
Easy & Fast shipping ����������������,7
"Artwork Design is great. Upon closer inspection, the design has small textures that when printed look like a bad screen print or curing. It is printed and cured 100% properly. Just me being dumb. The tracking leaves a little to be desired. One shipment through usps and the other was ups delivering to usps which left a blind spot in tracking that made me think it was lost. All in all, good product.",7
I am impressed by how quickly my order was processed & recieved.My son loves his new mug & shirt.,7
Softest shirt I own. Love it. Nice hoodie at a good price too,7

"The whit for the shield was gray, I would have preferred a whiter white. Like the shield in the military history page.",7
Huge selection!Great service and fast delivery!,7
Theres a very chart of the size description. Which was very helpful. Only reason I took a star off was for the delayed delivery.,7
"The tee you get is exactly how it looks on the website. Of course, sizing is an experiment on a first order with any company; but I found that the sizes were true to form. I love that you can see your artwork on different colors, fabrics and fit. It makes a huge difference in what I have chosen, all factored in. I've ordered 3 times, 4-8 shirts each time. Never a mistake, except one that I made myself. And gave the duplicate tank I ordered to a friend. Now she loves it too!No surprises, great artists, quality products and shipping times that rival Amazon (well not same or next day, but that's nuts). Absolute 5 stars and more.",7
The 3XL lightweight hoodie is much smaller than your 3XL standard shirts. Fits more like an XL.,7

Great job.Excellent service.,7
"Very easy to navigate the website and good choice of colors and fabric, styles and accessories.Definitely will use this company in the future.",7
Love the shirts. Came faster than expected,7
"So I wash the T-shirts once and there is multiple problems, one bled into itself, another one has several creases on the design. I washed them on a normal gentle cycle, so that is not the issue. I also turn the shirts inside out as per instructions on the tag.Also the prints are a little faded when you get them and its not the best quality, but it���������s cool.No biggie, I only paid $13 for a T-shirt. My suggestion is that you let people know ahead of time and recommend how to care for them. Unfortunately, The quality is probably going to make me hesitant to get a bunch more shirts. Love the variety of designs though.........The stickers and the art print I got were good....I���������ll definitely be coming back for more after I st",7
I ordered five shirts. They got here fast and were of great quality. I will definitely be ordering from TeePublic again when the need arises. Excellent Service!,7
One of my items failed to arrive and TeePublic replaced it immediately.I appreciated the very prompt and friendly attention to the issue and especially the ease of arriving at a solution.,7
"I love pizza, old fashioned hurgusburgers, famous chili cheese dogs, mad bong-hits, and my new shirt!!!CAN YOU DIG IT!!!????",7
Two items I purchased were way too small for the size ordered. I have purchased its in the past and not had this issue. Thete is no way they will fit their intended recipients. I sent an email requesting an exchange.,7
My husband LOVES his new t-shirts... esp the christmas dumpster fire one,7
"The quality of the shirts was fine. Really the 3 star rating is because shipping took forever and a half. My order arrived about 3 weeks later, so be sure you allow at least a month for it's arrival, just in case.",7
"Beautiful prints, quality t shirts, great price, and shipping was quick!",7
The shirts are good quality and the transfers are well done.Reasonable price.Love the indie art.,7

Exactly as expected and arrived just in time for christmas!,7
Love that there are so many designs! Kudos to all the artists! Continue to improve quality of tee material. I have purchased a couple tees that quickly shrunk after just one or two washes :( And your women���������s sizes do not run true to size (they run small). I like your customer service. And I appreciate how fast items ship. LOVE it w,7

I had two shirts in my order. One is just fine. The other has the print entirely off center and it's horrible.,7
"Everything SEEMED too good to be true. all I have to do is upload my artwork and they take care of the rest? yes... on paper. here's what really happens. you place an order on Feb 15th - they send you a tracking number that never ships. In MARCH you ask where your order is. they send out a new one. it takes a few weeks all over again. Then after a few washes, EVEN washing them inside-out, your label peels off your shirts and they're trashed anyway. Save yourself and your customers a few headaches, take your business and your artwork somewhere else. it's impossible to reach someone in a timely manner, they have no idea where your stuff is, went, or if it ever actually existed.",7
"TeePublic is the best, most reliable, affordable t shirt company on the market",7
Immanuel Quickley is my wifes favorite Knick and she loves the tee shirt. Woman's size ran small and there was no problem requesting larger size,7

I love this company and their comfortable and affordable Tee's. I've order twice with a total of 7 shirts and they never disappoint. Great quality and quick delivery!,7
"FINAL: They were keen and cool about the replacement. Somethings kinda didn't seem to match up between how I was ordering a color replacement and what they said they had in stock, but they did all the right things for a fix, so, I'll put to a 5. Things happen. How they are handled make all the diff. Add: They contacted me immediately about it, and we are working to see about the exchange. Also professional and apologized so far. Will update at finish. I was sure I ordered a black Tee, but got it as ""white"", which wasn't even a white tee. It was grayish white. The print was left white (so white on grayish white shirt), which would be ok if outlined. Nope. And, they didn't change the graphic to match the tee. So, small print on large shirt. Aaaannnd, they don't accept returns.",7
"One of the easiest-to-navigate websites I���������ve used, both for ordering and tracking package. Very pleased with the quality of the tee shirt I ordered when i",7
"Ordering products is simplified & easy. Love the options & choices. TeePublic also offers different styles of T-Shirts besides the basic & matching mask. Delivery did take awhile due to Covid, but TeePublic kept me informed of my delivery status via email. I have & will continue to recommend TeePublic",7
"Great shirts, Great Price!!",7
"I ordered stickers, a face mask, and a tshirt themed from some more news.It was shipped in three seperate packages. They advised on shipping time for each.All three packages arrived ahead of estimate. The tshirt was true to size and washed well.The mask fit well and the stickers were awesome.Would definitely order again.",7
Blutengel is a phenomenal band and it's a pleasure to buy their merchandise from TeePublic.,7

"Quick turnaround, quality t shirts, good printing. Sizing is pretty good too.",7
"Update on the wrong size shirts... Tee Public reached out and replaced the shirts with the right size!The were courteous and backed their product as promised. The shirts are super soft and the graphics are really well done and I can tell will hold for the life of the shirt.A little slow to respond but to be expected in our current climate maybe.This will be my ""go to"" T Shirt company forever!",7

Excellent quality of shirt and print. Very happy and will be ordering again soon.,7
"Is it weird to say I enjoyed having to reach out to the customer service?? When my order fell into limbo (I had a confirmation that it had shipped but the tracking update kept saying that it was being prepared to be shipped) I was quite upset because a) I didn't have my order and b) my severely socially anxious self was going to have to reach out to customer service which I was dreading. HOWEVER, once I sent my message explaining the contradicting tracking info, the person who responded to my message was quick to respond, came across as genuinely friendly, and was quickly able to locate the issue and correct it. My order arrived promptly two days later. I have written off online ordering places before because dealing with issues was such a stressful, nightmarish ordeal but after communicating with customer service here, I feel very comfortable continuing using this site for future purchases.",7

"I order a white tank top that had black wording on it and I absolutely adore the design and the top BUT it came with a rather noticable dark yellow dye spot roughly the size of a dime right on the front under the wording... kind of dampened the experience, I hope I can use bleach or something to remove the spot",7
Easy ordering. Correspondence/directions on website are spot on.Received the shirt in the time indicated.My son in law loves it!,7

Fast delivery. Cheap prices. Great quality of fabrics on shirts. Comfortable and fits perfectly!,7
"The T-shirt I bought is exactly as advertised! My husband loved it! Good quality. It took quite a long time to get the item, but I guess it���������s due to Covid issues. I would recommend buying from this company and hopefully delivery time will be qu",7
"Love the look, colors and style but I went up a size and it was still pretty firm fitting... I willKnow for next time!!",7
"Designs were great, so many options. Baby onesie is a good quality and stickers are patiently waiting to get stuck to something.",7
"TeePublic is a great site for fun t-shirts especially for men though they are also one of the few companies that has t-shirts for plus size women. My only criticism is the limited choices in colors for curvy v-neck women's t-shirts. I would like to wear more than black, red, or hot pink! I have ordered from TeePublic multiple times for my husband, children, and myself. We have always been happy with the quality, options in material, speed of delivery, and most importantly when ordering online the sizing is accurate. Great company but please get more t-shirt colors for curvy women!!!",7
Came exactly as expected! The graphic looks great.,7
"Great quality and shipped quickly, always a great selection",7
The shirt was delivered sooner than promised.,7
They do great work ! I buy from this place all the time keep up the good work all of the artists. We love it,7
"I am really appreciative of their customer service. Somehow my autocorrect updated my shipping address to an old address I had over a year ago, and my order was sent there. TeePublic was great, and let me tell them what happened and sent out a new order to the correct address. The shirt itself looks great too, with good colors.",7
"The design is super cute but also blurry on the t-shirt, like the image was moved while setting. It does not look like a professionally done t-shirt.",7
Poor quality sweater and it was an iron on. I know because I've made shirts before. Cheap. Cheap. Cheap. Save your money and make your own stuff. Lesson learned for sure.,7
