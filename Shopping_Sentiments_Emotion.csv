"Every time I order from TeePublic, it's nothing but a smooth process. If I ever need an exchange or have a question about my order, the Customer Service is phenomenal. All the employees are very courteous, and unlike other companies that take days/weeks to respond, when you send an email to TeePublic, they respond within 24 hours, if not minutes.I now solely use TeePublic when I want long-lasting, well-made T-shirts at great value. So very grateful.",0

"Very quick and prompt received package quickly.Good quality exactly what I ordered. thanks,",0
"I loved the designs I chose for the face masks, but was unaware that because of the pleats in the design, some of the verbiage is unable to be read (tucks under my chin.) Also, the elastic came unsewn on one mask before I'd even worn it. I was a little disappointed.",3

"My first order was flawless. However, my second order was not. My order was split into two separate shipments which was an additional charge that I didn't know about until my order was complete and I saw the price difference. Then I got my shirts and one of them was less than stellar. It looked like it had been washed several times before sent out and that was disappointing. The print wasn't clear. Overall, the shipping was fast and I got all of my items. So, I'm willing to purchase again because I like the various designs.",3
"I had a sizing problem with my order. Eliza, your representative, was extremely helpful and made my order correct.This was done so quickly that I have to give a giant Shout-Out of ""Hurray!"" for TeePublic and it's reps!!I will be doing more business with your organization.Thank-you, John Carman",0

"Blotchy art on the shirt. There are white specks all over the designs. WOW. Very frustrating. The art on the website looks sharp, but the shirts look like the ink on the printer was running out.",5
"Cool shirt! It was exactly what I thought I was ordering. The process was smooth and fun too. I liked knowing some of my money went to a small business artisan, rather than all to a big megacorp.",1
We love the tee shirts and thank you!The xl woman's shirt is very small though.It fits me like a size medium would.I really would have like it to be extra large!!,0
"I ordered matching shirts for myself and my best friend who is 900 miles away. I received my shirt and my friend initially did not, which was disappointing and upsetting.

"Design printing came severely flawed with portions of the print missing. If TeePublic was doing business in a store, this shirt would have never passed inspection. I contacted TeePublic with a photo for a resolution. I was offered a remake but 10 days later there is still no delivery date for this Christmas party shirt. I was very disappointed due to the cost and poor quality and customer service. I will not do business and do not recommend this business.",3
Thank you TeePublic. I made a mistakeon my order and it was fixed no problem.,0
Exactly what i ordered! Couldn't be happier! This is a Christmas gift that I know my mom will love. Thank you so much!!!,0
Well I was going to cancel my order because I hadn't received it after trying to track it from UPS to my post office and neither had my order after days of tracking I took a chance and contacted your help center to get a refund and explained my problem to Alex and he was very helpful and kind after he said he would give me a refund and also let me know he could put in a reorder and ship it through a different company if I wanted. I agreed to do that because after all it was a Christmas gift and TeePublic was the only place I found them. I now can wrap them up and put them under the tree.Thanks to Alex and TeePublic for all their help. I think Alex should get a raise for going above and beyond to help this old woman have a great Christmas. Thanks again.,0

"I purchased 4 shirts for an upcoming trip to Disney.Love the designs, but the execution and final product need some work.Depending on the shirt, mediums and larges typically fit me.The 4 that I purchased were a size large based on the sizing chart that had a picture of someone of similar size and build to me.Well, that's way off.One of the 4 shirts fit like the sizing chart indicates and all 4 fit differently and appear to be different lengths.Two of the shirts are the length of XL.Both of those also have printing issues.One has visible vertical lines across the image.The other has a very faded, almost blurry image while the picture on line shows a sharp and crisp image.So one of the shirts fits great, one is ok, and two are terrible.This purchase was disappointing to say the least.",3
"I ordered 2 Tee's. One for myself and 1 for my husband. The shipping was kinda of slow( I was aware that it would be). When the shirts arrived we both love them. Perfect in every way. The fit, the art, the material. I would not change a thing. I was kinda of wary of ordering because I have ordered from other places where the sizes are wonky. These are perfect. Thank you",0
The design of Banjo & Kazooie is amazing and spot on for a Smash Bros. setup. I love everything about this. Thank you so much.,0
"We like the hoodie and are, overall, happy with the product. I was disappointed with the transfer of the art to the material. The lack of definition is disappointing because you cannot read the text which makes up the art. Without being able to read the text, the true power and impact of the art is lost.",3
Love it! Thank you!,0
"Items arrived sooner than offered, quality of materials are great, stickers amazing too, highly recommended. Thanks for a great delivery, thanks!",0
"Very disappointed. The art work is good, however the print is significantly smaller than what was advertised, I would say by 50 percent at least. ALSO I ordered a men's medium and it's the size of an extra small, which barely fits and makes the print seem even smaller",3
My son loves his shirt! He had the biggest smile on his face all day! Thanks!,0

"Great idea to support local artists but there is a severe communication problem with this business. I ordered a couple of magnets for the fridge on a lark. Paid for the order via PayPal. No problem, everything went through and transfers done. Got a confirmed shipped with stops along the way until it was mysteriously lost. Many emails back and forth with excuses for replies and the order was repeated by TeePublic. Again with the delays and emails back and forth (12) not including replies with the same excuses. Finally I had had enough and contacted PayPal with a complaint. After all, I wanted the dumb Billie Eilish magnets before she retires. After PayPal got involved directly I had the magnets within 1 week. Many thanks to PayPal. * I have to add that the company changed the independent artist they used and like I say, I had the magnets within 1 week.*",0

I ordered a 3X to fit a little bigger on me and it came labelled as a 3X but fit the way a large would and that is 2 sizes too small. I was highly disappointed because I was really looking forward to it and it was too short and tight when it should have actually been a little bigger.,3

"Very disappointed. Though the colour and fit of the shirt was good, the print on the back was transferred as if it was faded from the get go, and there is a nick/mark in the print that didn't transfer evenly. Quality shirt, low quality transfer/print. I don't expect the colours to last if they started like this. And it was far too late to replace it, because I bought it for autism acceptance month!",3
"Vacationing in Northern, MI, my 4 year old grandson spotted a t-shirt in the window of a t-shirt store. The front of the shirt was guitars of legends. They had one in an adult size. He was very disappointed, so we left without.I searched the internet and found your web site, and the t-shirt!!!I also went back and found a shirt with a drum set that looks like his set of drums.He is going to be in 7th heaven when he opens this gift for Christmas.He loves his guitar and drums, and these shirts will make him as happy as can be.Thank You!!!",0

"Both the tee shirt and mask were a big disappointment. I will be slower to purchase and not recommend. Both items turned out to be not what was advertised. The IPA tee shirt was illegible and it was only composed of text do that is obviously a huge problem. The picture on the web site showed a mask with no pleats. No pleats. The mask that was delivered had pleats and the design, the main selling feature and read I bought that particular mask, didn���������t work at all with pleats. The graphic made no sense and was in recognizable. The biggest problem is the deception. If I had known what I was buying. If what I got was what was offered to me, then it would have been all my choice. The bait and switch was the most disappointing. From now on, if I see something cool on the site, I will doubt if that is what I���������d get. I���������l",3
Three our of the seven shirts I ordered had issues with them. One shirt had cracked printing on delivery and the other two shirts has color issues. The print was way too dark on two of the shirts that you could not even see the imagine of what the shirt had. I will definitelynot be reordering shirts with this company again. Don't even know if its worth throwing a refund claim in. Very disappointed.,3
Always fun and original designs. Ordering is so quick and easy.,1
My purchase arrived when promised. I was very impressed with the design and quality of the shirt. Will make a great gift for my Grandson. Thank You!,0

It just made my husband very happy ���������,1

Good quality shirts at a fair price. Thanks again,0
I really like the tshirts I ordered thank you,0
"Quality is good. Shipment arrived as promised. However, I was extremely disappointed in the screen print color/darkness/visibility. Cost was $53 and for the inability to see what was on the sweatshirt was a let down to say the least. It was not dark enough for the color (heather gray) of sweatshirt I ordered. You can barley see that there is writing and a picture.",3
Very pleased!!!! Thanks!!,0
My shirt looks and feels great. I like the unusual designs and will be back. Thanks guys.,0
Never used Tee before. Pleasantly surprised by the quick delivery to my destination. Thanks!,0
"I was very disappointed when I received the tee shirt with faded, muted colors. You could not differentiate between the 4 shades of red, which totally changed the appearance of the design. The colors were not bright and vibrant like the image on the webpage. The shirt looks like it's been washed 100 times and left out in the sun. Perhaps the printing press needed new ink. And perhaps the white tee shirt was not as heavy duty as I had hoped, resulting in a depressing, splotchy, orangey design. Not cool.",3
Excellent service and experience. I am wearing my new shirt right now and I love it!!!!!!! Thank you the awesome packaging too!,0
Really disappointed. The font is the same color as the shirt and is completely illegible.Not as advertised.,3
"Can barely read the words, and the images have a static effect, barley see some of the photos, and paid WAY TOO much for something that���������s poor quality. Won���������t be ordering from them again. Thought I was lucky to have found something that means something to the Latino culture but was disappointed to get something I could���",3

I'm extremely disappointed and will not be ordering from you guys again. I know that we are in a time of crisis, but it still should not have taken this long. Other companies don't take this long to ship an order of 2 shirts.",3

Sizes are not consistent across different color shirts. Working on getting an exchange . Very happy with the items which came in correct sizing.,1

I like the designs and the ease of ordering, shipping, and delivery.What I would really like to see is a better quality of cotton/materials.

It would encourage me to buy more if I could rely on purchasing a tee shirt that would last more than a season or two.Thank you for your products and the opportunity to comment. Be safe!Frank Moore III",0

Their shirts are so long lasting especially after you wash them. They don���������t fade or change colors by no means! I enjoy ordering from them as they will give you updates on your order and shipment. Than,1
"I just got my tees and so far I'm thrilled.I don't imagine they'll last forever because they are not silk screen, but more of an iron on so they'll eventually peel, but for now they are good for my purposes.",1
UPDATE:Excellent customer service.It was my fault yet the offered to replace the shirt.Highly recommended.The quality is top notch and I found out so is the customer service.The shirt is fine but I made a mistake ordering the wrong color and there is no way to exchange it.Disappointing,3
fast fast fast! easy transaction and then great communication and then boom it arrived! great quality and love the shirt! will order again. thanks,0
"Wonderful selection of t-shirts that can bemade personal as gifts. Good quality material and very promptly posted. T-shirts look smaller than I imagined, so maybe order a larger size, but this could be used as an incentive to lose the Christmas weight!!! Thank you",0
I'm very happy with both the price and quality of the product I bought.,1
"I'm a first time customer, but sadly I haven't had a good experience. I ordered a ""Blair's Goat Farm"" tee shirt well before Christmas because it was going to be a Christmas present. I was super excited when it arrived, but when I opened the package it was the wrong tee shirt. The enclosed order form had my correct order, but a ""Queen"" tee shirt had been sent instead. I hurriedly followed all the correct protocol for returns on the website, but it's been days now, and I still haven't heard a thing from the company. I understand that it's a busy time of year, but it looks like now there is no way I'll have this corrected by Christmas. Big disappointment.",3
"I really loved the graphics.The designs looked as good in person as they did online.Thanks, they will make great gifts.",0

My grandson loved the sweatshirt. He is going on a fishing trip to the Outer Banks! Thank you for getting it here before Christmas!!,0
"My experience was wonderful, ordered the wrong size. For some reason female shirts seem to be harder to judge the size on when I've bought them for people. My exchange was super easy no hassle just straight up great customer experience. Very helpful no stress nobody asked me a thousand questions or made my life difficult with the exchange. I can't stress enough how helpful and kind that is not only as a customer but also as a person. Thank you all",0

"Came really early. Though, I thought the shirt itself would be a kind of dark grey and the symbol would be a bit more orange. But honestly, I ain't mad at it. I got my money's worth! And it fit so PERFECT. It's like it was tailored just for me. Thanks TeePublic!",0
FAB T-shirt!Printing and quality of shirt superb!Thank you!,0
"I ordered a relaxed fit tee and got a regular fit. I understand mistakes happen but there was absolutely no way to contact anyone for an exchange. It looks like there is, but after clicking on it, it leads you back to the same useless page.

On our original order we ordered a ladies large shirt but it was too small so we contacted TeePublic and they replaced the shirt at no cost to us. Thank you very much.,0
I was disappointed in the quality of the printing on the shirt. The wording in the middle was blurred and you could tell it was copied from another item and printed on the shirt. I will not be purchasingfrom this site again..poor quality and obviously the design was hijacked from another.,3

Quickly shipped & very cute.Fits well.Thanks!,0
"Fantastic shirt, the highest quality I have seen.Thank you so much!!",0
Very happy with my order! One of the shirts design was a tad crooked but not to the point of unbearable. And a very strong smell of vinegar but I think that happens when it comes to shorts! Overall happy!,1
To be honest never used the website before but the shirts were made great and arrived on time. Thank you and will use again!,0
"shirts arrived when expected, and appear to be of high quality.Have not washed them yet, to see how they wear , but I like the patterns I selected and hope to enjoy wearing them for years.thanks",0
The order process was user friendly and straightforward. We received our shirt as quickly as promised. Our only disappointment is the poorer quality of the fabric as well as the sub standard quality of the print medium.,3
"I have been so happy with every shirt and sticker and notebook I've ordered through Tee Public.I had one issue with a printing/pleating problem on a pleated mask, and they turned around and sent me new masks that were perfect- for free -and with quick turn around in the Christmas season.",1

I ordered a medium size T-shirt recently but it was too small. It was easy to find the guidelines about contacting the company for a larger size that would fit. The person who replied was very helpful and I got the right size in great time. I thank that person for his kind compassionate response to my problem.Great work,0

Very Happy with my order. The Prints on the shirts came out PERFECT. The colorsare nice and bright. What I am beyond happy about is the size of the image on the shirt. I was hoping for them to be huge prints & they are which i am stoked about. Thanks again. Looking forward to getting some hoodies when TeePublic runs another sale.,0
"The overall quality of the sweatshirt was disappointing. The graphics were drawn well but the print quality and actual sweatshirt look very cheap for $40 but I was okay with it because my daughter is a huge Wings of Fire fan. Then, when I washed her white sweatshirt in cold water on delicate it came out with pink blotches.",3

"I ordered three Tee Shirts, and am very happy with them.The quality of the printing is very good.The price was fair.It took a while for my order to get to me.But that can die attributed to slow delivery and mail.My thanks to Tee Republic for a satisfying purchase experience.",0
My tee shirt arrived quicker than expected. The design was as described. I'm very happy with the service and the results.,1
The hoodie itself is soft and warm. Fits as expected. The design is printed on a grey patch so there is a grey rectangle on the front with the design on top of it. It doesn't look as nice as I expected.,3
The T-shirt I ordered was a gift for a friend and so absolutely loved it!! So thank you for providing exactly what I saw online! Thank you!,0
"Poor quality print, shirt missing from order, no return response from customer service.I made initial inquiry last WED with no response until 2nd complaint and posting review.I will happy to update experience once all issues are resolved.*Updated*Vendor has since corrected issues with replacement of higher quality print shirt and fulfillment of original order.Thank you for making this right.",0
"While the turnaround time from ordering to receiving was timely (I paid extra for UPS delivery), I am very disappointed in the quality of the T-shirts. Holding them in front of me, I can see through them. Cheap for what you pay.",3

"My girls (13&10) had on their Christmas list ""A shirt with my name on it"". I had no idea where to look without getting it custom made. I googled their names and TeePublic website came up. They loved it so much. I was very impressed with the quality and fast shipping that I ordered one for myself! Thank you for your service! ����",0
Recieved what I ordered. Thank you so much.,0
The photo of the design is deceiving. I thought it would be shiny instead it was more of a worn out or vintage look. Just disappointed after waiting almost two months to finally receive the package to have it not be what you expected is greatly disappointing,3
"Great range of product for the eclectic punter. Fabulous, prompt and professional service. Thank you",0

Was a pleasure looking through all the wicked designs from all the artist best part is your helping each other not some big company support individuals,1
Shirts came on time and quality is excellent!! My son will enjoy his Christmas presents. Thank you,0
Poorest quality t shirt. The iron on also has brown marks around it and the t shirt itself is truly the worst quality! Truly disappointed since the photo made it look super nice,3
This sight is awesome! Finally got my shirts and they are well worth the wait! Thank you to all you artists for allowing us into your artistic brains with your concepts onto your shirts!,0

"Love TeePublic, not only are there a wide range of products, The website was easy to use, the pricing was great and the delivery time was amazing. I ordered from NZ and received my items less than 7days later. Quality is amazing. Thank you!",0
"I got my T-shirt after a month and when I got it, the shirt was stuck together by the lettering on the front.. it was completely ruined. The T-shirt and the image on the front felt sooooo cheap. It literally just broke apart and stuck onto each other. Such a waste of $30!!!! So disappointed.",3
I received my Hoodie quickly and I like it a lot thank u so much,0
The T shirts were well crafted and high quality. The images were clean and colorful. I'm very happy with my order.,1
I purchased three shirts and one of them arrived with significant defects. It's a red shirt with a black graphic on it but parts of the graphic were white and looked like the black had either been rubbed off or not printed properly printed in the first place. There were also white and black splotches on parts of the tee shirt when it arrived. Ther other two shirts turned out fine but I am very disappointed with the quality of the third.,3
"Thank you guys so much, I absolutely love my T-shirt.I Will be shopping with you guys more often.",0
The T-shirt looks even better in person! I know my friend is going to love it especially since Silver Surfer stuff is soooo hard to come by!! Thank you so much!,0
i love this t-shirt.it fits me very well.but there is one slight problem that the shirt thread was hanging out on the front of the shirt.i support the artist all the way for doing a great job on designing the shirt.and i contacted the customer service and they solved it for me.and i'm a very happy customer.thanks so very much!i give this a thumbs up.��������,0
Wording on shirt is the wrong color and customer service hasn��������,4
"I received three tees that were done well.However, I ordered a specific screenprint of a beloved tv mom (Phylicia Rashad) and the shipper who sent the t-shirt clearly did a screengrab of someone else's print, bc the watermark was printed on the t-shirt. To clarify, the photo on the site shows the watermark on it ""Hi Phylicia jami360""but naturally I expected that would not appear on the actual shirt.Huge disappointment. I would never wear a shirt like that.",3
I really like your designs. My latest order got lost in the mail and you took care of it with a replacement. Thanks.,0

I really enjoy clever T shirts because they express a sense of humor or irony. The shirts I have purchased do both.,1
"Five stars didn't happen simply because my long-sleeved T has off-center print. So, the message I got the shirt for is not centered on the shirt front. Odd. Otherwise, all purchases are beautiful. I love how roomy my mask is. Thanks for wonderful stuff!",0

I���������ve always orderd from you guys and love your products. This was the first time I had an issue. I will say it had nothing to do with The company itself.

The order arrived promptly but I was so disappointed with the T-shirt.The color was so off - what was supposed to be a dark red came out as a very pale coral color.Since it's an emblem of my high school I expected it to look like the real thing.,3
had problem with a shirt.Problem fixed quickly and easily.I am happy,1
"I had an issue with the shirt I ordered due to seams and my sensory issues, and they very quickly printed and shipped a replacement on a different style shirt.

"I am happy with everything - the timely delivery, the quality of the shirt and the artwork - except for one thing.The artwork is off-center by one inch.In other words, the artwork is four inches from the right sleeve seam and two inches left sleeve seam.I noticed it immediately.Other than that I am happy with the product.",1
Ordering was quick and painless.The order got to me quickly as well. The quality of the print was a little bit disappointing but the designs themselves were awesome,3
Thank you ����������,0
"I am not looking for a refund or exchange (not worth the hassle), but I was a little disappointed when my shirt came and the background behind the wording was pink, rather than white; the white was what I ordered. It looked like it may have been used and washed with the red shirt bleeding onto the white portion���������changing it to pink. Needed the white to match the shirt we gave her brother a year ago from Etsy. J",3
"I did not expect the customs to be nearly $40 for some t-shirts so that was frustrating. Also, the print quality is average at best--,kind of disappointed.",3
"Shipping was fast, but I pay extra for that. Quality was less than anticipated. The design is very faded and poor quality. Not what was pictured.. disappointed.",3
Thank you! Next time I will order on time !,0
The tee is cool but the sizing is kinda sucky. Ordered a large and it fits more like a medium. Kinda disappointed.,3
It's great! Was able to change a mistake I made before my order shipped. Didn't know that was a thing or is TeePublic the only ones out here doing like that lol! My order is here and I'm looking spicy! Thank you and keep at it!,0

"I received the tshirt in a timely manner for my husband's birthday.However, on the back of the dark purple shirt were 2 areas that appeared to be bleach stains and on the front.below the logo was the word ""HITS"" in very light letters.This is clearly not on the picture that I ordered.Very disappointed.",3
"Ordered in the past from teepublic and was very happy. This time not so much. The quality of the regular shirt wasn't the same as the past. It's fairly flimsy based on this order.Also, one of the items, that I had as a sweater, the design wasn't big enough to make it look right. It seems like no matter the size ordered, the graphic size doesn't change. Pretty disappointed overall when I compare it to previous orders.",3
"Excellent service and communication throughout the entire process.Product was perfect upon arrival in Australia!!Thank you - quality outfit, quality work!!",0
"Surprised an old friend - made her day! Shirt was excellent quality, price was reasonable and the shipping efficient. Thank you.",0

I aways get quality t shirts and am happy with thia site.A lot.of unusual and fun designs,1
After ordering 11 tee shirts I realized one of them came in a color I did not order. I reached out to tee public and they sent me another 2XL in the correct color. NO CHARGE! Thank You so much Tee Public,0
"Love my shirt and mug!Been showing it off to other people! They love it as well! Thought it was hilarious!I told them where to buy it if they want to buy one for themselves!Mug cake quicker than expected and shirt came right on time!Thank you for taking the time to complete my order!Unlike what the shirt reads, I would highly recommend!",0
Lack of good packaging tracking. Poor delivert. It took 19 days for delivery when the web page said 6-8 days.,3
The shirt came exactly as it appeared on the website and it���������s true ,6
"TeePublic went above and beyond in providing service and being responsive. I bought a shirt as a gift for my uncle, and he gave me the wrong zip code in the ship to address. When the shirt shipped ti the wrong city, I alerted TeePublic and they promptly shipped a second shirt to the right address. I was very impressed by this. They could have waited until the first shirt was returned, or charged me extra for the additional shipping cost, but they didn't. Class act. Thank you, TeePublic, I'll be buying more shirts from you in the future!",0
"Awesome shirt! Fast shipping and great price, Will buy from again! Thank you!",0
Would of been 5 stars just would of like the order to get to me quicker. That said I'm not against ordering from this site in the future.Thanks,0

"Service was great, love our tshirts! Only problem, tried to change my size on my placed order through email, unfortunately never received correspondence. My first order, hopefully I���������ll know better next order.Thank you kindly",0
I really do enjoy the final product. The quality is nice and I was even happier to see it was preshrunk cotton. If I had one critique it would maybe be on the sizes. A size chart would have been better to have to pin point a perfect size. Apart from that though everything is great and the design is amazing.,1
Exactly what I ordered. Thanks!And got it quickly.,0
"I like how this t-shirt design was offered for both men's and women's shirts. I do not like that the design was not centered on my women's shirt, and the men's shirt was sewn irregularly.",4
Very happy with the shirt and the fast delivery!,1
Everything was just as I ordered !! Thank you !!,0
I ordered a sweater for Christmas on 12/8. It came on 12/20 and it was a plain black sweater!!! There was no design on it!!! I emailed them and they gave me my money back. Very upsetting as this was for my sons Christmas gift!,3

The label was ready on May 28, 2020, and it is now June 11, 2020. While the masks are nice, the customer service is abysmal and there is a better chance that I will not shop here again because of it.What a shame because the artist renderings on the masks are beautiful, but I cannot trust that I will ever even see a response for our missing order, for which I have already contacted the Better Business Bureau.",3
"Fast shipping, looks and feels great and fit is TRUE TO SIZE! So happy about that! :)",1
I enjoy the comfort and exact fit. The material used in the products have been excellent. The only downside that I've experienced is that the decal on Tee shirts seem to be still too fresh and not absorbed in the fabric. Thanx Tee Public,1

The women's xl wasnot an xl, and the writing on the Hamilton child's shirt was so light it was barely visible- and the shirt itself was very wide and body. The masks and stickers were good, but the shirts were NOT.",3
"I really enjoyed the work available here on TeePublic. And they have great sales, so I purchased a lot of tees for Christmas gifts! I ordered these at the end of November and despite the reassurance that they'd included the shipping in the 7-10 business day delivery estimate, that was not accurate. Butthe reality is, it was Christmas time, and a lot of orders were coming in.I did received them just in time for Christmas, and they were overall nice tees. I think I got a lot of value shopping here, and maybe next time I order I'll be able to bump up my review 2 more stars. But for this round that timing element almost crushed the entire purpose for my order.",1

T-shirt was exactly as advertised. Very happy with my purchase.,1
Everything fo the most is ok. Where you guys are severely lacking is color choices for shirts bigger than 2x. The basic boring colors and styles that you offer are just that boring.

The print is awesome and I love ordering from here. My issue is with the hoodie itself. For the amount I paid I was expecting a better quality hoodie. I ordered a 2x and its fit is on the small side. Also the sleeves at the wrist do not fit well and the seam is off. It's disappointing when you are spending $50 or more.,3

I will admit that I don���������t remember reading the description which probably had the measurements.The magnetic strip was smaller than the sticker, it was no longer than middle finger which was another disappointment.

"With the recent theft of my order, you guys came through with flying colors. I am very impressed!Thank you!!!",0
"Design was great, but printed out grainy and not quite centered on the t-shirt. It will be fine for what I bought it for, but I am disappointed with the quality of the print.",3
Great product - made great gift. Receiver loved it. Easy ordering. Thank you !!!!,0
"Good quality, great design.Thank you",0
Love the shirt. My niece is going to love it for Christmas. Thank you so much!!,0

My item arrived in very good condition + timely.Thank you,0
"Excellent service, communication, and product!!!From beginning to end, I am extremely satisfied. Ordered shirts and stickers both were perfectly as pictured on the website.

My issue was resolved quickly! Thank you!!your AWESOME!!,0
"I ordered myself a face mask along with a laptop case. The mask came first as expected, but I must say that I was very disappointed. First off, the mask itself was extremely thin, to the point where it could've been easy to tear. Now I understand that the warning did say that these masks weren't for medical usage, but I expected a little better material than what I got. Second, the printing for the mask was completely off centered. It was so bad that bits of white edging were on the mask (When it was suppose to be completely black). Thirdly, the designing in the middle was off to the right side of the mask.But I remained hopeful for my laptop case to only get the same results. Although the printing was much better, there still was some awkward white edging (Also suppose to be mostly black). The printing was a little brighter than the picture which isn't a huge deal for me. (But I can understand how people can be upset with this). Lastly, the case didn't even fit my computer. I have a 15 inch laptop, and I struggled just trying to slip the darn thing in. Once it was in, it wouldn't even zip up. So I'm left here quite disappointed with these products. As much as I love the designs here, I sadly do not see myself shopping on here anymore.",3
It was kind of hard to tell from your model which size to get. My brother wears a 2x so I ordered the 3x and by the time he washed and dried them they fit perfectly.Also it was nice that you gave the choice of weight of fabric. Thanks,0
I received the wrong hooded sweatshirt. Waiting on Caroline to let me know what my next step is to correct the error. Very disappointing as it was a surprise birthday gift which will now be late.,3
Average quality t-shirts. Not worth the cost. Wont be buying from here again.,4
The order was filled in a timely manner. The sizes of the T shirts were not accurate. I always wear a medium but these were ENTIRELY too small. They were skin tight. A real disappointment!,3
"Have wanted to order these Popcast tee shirts for awhile.So, I stopped procrastinating about it and ordered two t shirts and a couple of magnets.So glad I did. The shirts are well made and color is just as described. Won't hesitate so long next time.Arrived within a week.Thanks!rbl",0
Love the t-shirt decal for the right price. Thank you,0

My 12 year old autistic grandson is totally DELIGHTED with his two new tee shirts! He has a Bi Black Sheltie and loves her so much which is why I searched online everywhere to find Bi Black Sheltie designstee shirts. KUDOS and THANK YOU!,0
"The tee I ordered was just what I wanted: beautifully and clearly printed in bright, vivid color. Great job��������� but: the tee was ordered as a gift for my size 14 daughter. She REALLY wanted it and planned to wear it for a particularly special occasion. She is tall and, generally, looks slender in most outfits. I ordered the tee in LARGE, thinking she could wear it comfortably over slacks. (She usually wears a size medium.) Well, the Big Day came and she put on the tee which fit her, in her words, ���������like a sausage casing, a tight sausage casing.��������� Double disappointment: hers and my own since the tee came with a ���������no return on special orders��������� statement. Hey, their tees ar",3
Things seem as advertised for the most part.The quality of the tee shirts are nice.My problem is that the logo that was ordered was horribly off-centered.Very disappointed.It is so bad I won't even be wearing it because it looks bad and like a mistake.,3
I found the quality of the material was severely lacking in that it was very thin. This material will not survive too many washings. Also I ordered a men's medium and it is more like a women's small. It is just not worth it to me to return the item. I will not be ordering from this company again,4
The designs were beautifully printed. As masks they're ineffective at snugly and completely covering my nose and chin and require constant readjustment. Therein lies my disappointment.,3
got package all is well thanks,0
"Shipped faster than I expected, great print quality and exactly as pictured. My son wants to live in his Bluey tshirt now hahaha! Thank you so much! I would definitely order from TeePublic again.",0
The quality of these T-shirts are amazing excellent priced very happy with my purchase and very fast shipping thanks guys,0

Order was correct and got products quickly will order again from this company,6
Designs were wonderful.High quality t shirts.Able to track our package with ease. Thank you.We will be repeat customers,0
"The artwork is amazing, however, the sizing is way off. The size chart is nowhere near the actual size. both shirts from two different vendors are much smaller than depicted. I would make an exchange but there is no way to contact the company. Very disappointed.",3
I was very happy with the help I received from TeePublic. They solved my problem and were very helpful.,1
"Very responsive customer service.Had to make a size change, and they were very prompt responding.New item was correct and here within a reasonable amount of time.",6

"You were the first (and, so far, the only) company to sell FROM merchandise.I'm sure that'll soon be fixed as soon as season 2 premieres, but for now thanks! I have the talisman shirt and it looks awesome. Got here quickly also. Don't see that much anymore.",0
"Unfortunately I'm disappointed. I ordered a mug and a shirt on 12/5/19. The first mug (only) arrived broken. I asked for a replacement and to date have not received it or the shirt.I asked for a refund and was promised only the portion for the mug. I asked for all of my refund and saw today that I will be given one. I know holiday season must be difficult but this was ordered, in my opinion, well in advance",3
Came quickly and was exactly what I ordered. Recommend buying 1 size up,6

So happy with my purchase! Shipping is very fast and pretty good quality for the price. Thanks!,0

"The shirt was printed beautifully and the service was fast and quick responding. The only down side is I had to lint roll the tshirt when it got here before I wrapped it up for. Christmas. Maybe going that little extra step for your customers would really impress them, because if I had sent this out to a different address and had to have the gift receiver have to lint roll a brand new shirt, it's not very impressive. Still though, I'll most likely purchase from you guys again, since the shirt's image printed so nicely. Thanks.",0
"Good quality face masks.Easy to put N95 filter underneath for extra protection.We are going to be wearing masks for a long time, thanks for adding some color and fun to a serious pandemic.",0
Advertising was misleading.When I purchased the premium tee shirt it was not heavier duty.Very thin tee shirt and very disappointed with the product.,3

"Another fast delivery, good quality item, Thanks!",0
I wanted to love this shirt!! The shirt material is practically see through but does feel soft. Then the print is not vibrant like the image I ordered showed and it sticks to everything. Also disappointed because there is an artist's logo in the top corner I didn't notice upon ordering. All in all pretty disapointed,3
"Great product at a fair price, well packaged and delivered in a timely way. Thank you!",0
The designs are AWESOME But the times on shipping terrible and when I receive the t-shirt the art wasn't centered on the t-shirt. They resolved it right away. But I wait to much to have something not well finish.. Thank you.,0

Worst yet, when clicking on ""track your order"" link, there are no further updates SINCE 7/13/2020 in Reno, NV when package was transferred to destination UPS mail facility...That is ONE WEEK AGO. There seems to be no way to contact TeePublic directly. Totally disappointing.",3
The shirts I ordered were awesome. I was happy I could find our favorites in sizes large enough for me and my husband. He's a big anime fan and you have a nice variety of designs to choose from. I will definitely use this site again. You also got the items shipped fast. Thank you,0
"I was disappointed with my purchase. I expected that the design was only printed on one side, which just looks weird. But the writing in the design is so small and dark, it's practically unreadable. It seems like it could have been proportioned better.",3

"Mugs look great.Excellent order experience, quick shipping, well packaged.Thanks!",0
"I selected 3 tee shirts this time, but only changed the tee type on the 3rd selection. I assumed that the type would apply to all three selections this time. I was a little disappointed to find 2 of them with the style that I didn't want, and only the last one being the style that I wanted for all three. Maybe make this clearer for everyone when checking out.",3
Its was beyond what I expected. Definitely not cheap material either. Thank you so much! I'm one happy lady!,0
The colors of the tee that were on the website were not the same color tones we received.The graphic was supposed to be red and white and the colors on our actual tees were orange red and creamy yelowish color. Disappointed with the color difference.,3
"Hoodie looks worn, but brand new. The black color is faded, The stenciled logo is checkered and faded-looking. The shirt is OK at best. I am disappointed, but not worth the hassle of return.",3

"I live in New Zealand. I couldn't get Rick and Morty t-shirts in the range and size options as Teepublic have on offer so I did a bit of homework about Teepublic first to double check I wasn't sending my money overseas to a scam. I ended up here on Trustpilot and to be honest the reviews were pretty bad: Poor quality, bad prints, wrong sizing, late delivery, the list goes on... But I went against my better judgement and went ahead with the sale. I have my t-shirts, they are good quality, the prints are fine and don't feel any different to any other printed shirts I've bought in the past. The sizes were on target and the delivery was 14 days from order placement. I couldn't be happier and I will use them again and recommend them to others. Thank you, TeePublic. Rob.",0
The only place to go!I have purchased many shirts from TeePublic and I have even uploaded my own art for purchase on different products. I love this amazing store and vendor. Thank you for making it so easy to share and buy innovative designs.,0

"The shirt is great, but the women���������s 3x is not a 3x. It is more like a 1x. Fortunately I routinely order up one size so it is merely tight, rather than a normal, comfortable fit.

The design was poorly printed on the shirt and it smelled like paint. the fabric is also thin and rough. I bought it as a gift and I was disappointed with the results. It may just be the specific item I bought but I was not satisfied and I will buy another shirt from somewhere else instead.",3

"TeePublic is a very accommodating website!I had to reorder a t-shirt for a child for the third time because of a size issue. TeePublic was so very gracious, not charging me any extra fees for the two extra t-shirts I ended up ordering (because the other two were too small). If ordering a child's t-shirt, you may want to order UP a size or two, just fyi. KUDOs, TeePublic, for allowing me to finally helping me get he RIGHT size for this precious child who is about to be adopted!I definitely will order from TeePublic again when the occasion arises!!Thank you, thank you!",0

I Only washed the T-shirt twice and the text is already fading. Extremely disappointing I will be looking into requesting a refundUPDATE originally gave one star but they contacted me as soon as I left the review. Turns out some spray that protects the print wasn't applied (or not enough at least) and they offered me a new shirt or a refund. Thought all of their products were like mine but it is abnormal for them and this is a quality operation. Great customer service I would buy from here again without any worries.,3
"I ordered 6 alike sweatshirts for an event that is coming up.They charged my credit card, processed and shipped the order WITHOUT telling me that they were using 2 different vendors for the sweatshirts...and they arrived with 4 the same color and 2 a noticeably different shade.Very disappointing.

The t-shirts came in a children's size large which was very disappointing. Needless to say the t-shirt didn't fit me at all!! The one t-shirt came in the wrong color and you couldn't read what it said. I will never order from this company again. Nor will I recommend it. Very disappointed.,3
Sizing is insanely small. Bought the shirt two sizes to big and fits like spandex. So very disappointed.,3
This was my first order and I am very happy with the service and product.I will be ordering again in the future.,1

I washed it once and the graphic is falling apart. Washed it inside out on gentle with cold water. I���������ve bought $10 shirts that have lasted much much longer and this one is $40!

"I was really disappointed with the tee shirt I ordered. I truly expected it to be silkscreened and instead both the image and text were rubbery stick ons.You'd think in this day and age companies would go the extra mile to make a quality product.Now i will have to wash the thing inside out, and hang to dry or we all know what will happen -- the design will start buckling, cracking and falling off.Won't be ordering again.",3
"I like the design of the shirt, but I must admit that I am very disappointed that the printing on the shirt was very much below par.The most noteworthy item is that the print on the championship belts, especially the world title above ""Flair"" is not readable.The other three are slightly better, but since the world title belt is atop the others, I expected that I would be able to read the print on it.Perhaps I received a below average product; I am not sure, since my other shirt had the same issue.",3
My order was shipped quickly and I was very happy with my shirts.,1
I am happy with my 2 tee shirts.I do prefer the 13.00 price rather than 20.00 so I always look for sale prices.There are some really cute tee shirts.Thank you for my tee shirts.,0
Package received timely. Exactly what I ordered and very satisfied. Legitimate site. Will order again from TeePublic.,6
"Shirts are much smaller/shorter than advertised. After wearing ONE time and through a standard wash/air dry, it is too small to wear. **Thanks for your reply, the shirt basically fit when I received it, after a wash it shrunk. I used the size chart.I'm sure you won't do an exchange after washing the items so your reply doesn't change my review. Thanks**",0
"I was disappointed in the graphics on my new Banana Splits shirt. It looks a small piece of artwork was enlarged for the shirt, making it look a bit blurry.",3
The 1st thing I noticed was the offensive smell the t-shirts have. I'm guessing its from the printing but I've purchased designed t-shirts at a store and they don't have this strong vinegar smell.The tee-shirt material is very cheap!Ipaid extra for what you called softer material.What you sent me is not soft.I purchased some shirts from you before and the t-shirts were much better. Perhaps you printed them on the wrong ones.I know I was charged for the higher priced ones.Two of these shirts were gifts and I don't even want to give them out as a gift.Very disappointed!,3
All went well from ordering to delivery. Thanks,0
Had issues with delivery the first time. Second time they arrived and are beautiful. Thanks to the artist and everyone involved - great shirts .,0
Very happy with customer service I ordered wrong size and they made things right very easy,1
10/28/20 The product material was adequate but the print was mediocre. The print was faded and color of the item I purchased was not the same as the color on the website. Very disappointing. *update(11/10/20) I received a prompt response by one of the customer service reps. TeePublic immediately sent me a new product correcting all the issues and even told me I could keep the old product. My rating has changed from 2 stars to 5 for their outstanding customer service.,3

"I'm very pleased with the products and the delivery time. I was happy for the bonus they sent me. I ordered three. Charlie Watts memorial tee shirts and one hoodie. They gave me an additional identical shirt that had a picture of a banana ������������ on the back. Thank you. I gave that one to my nephew who is in a wheelchair. The only thing I could say bad is some of the products were a light black instead of dark black and two of the shirts were a seemed to be of a slightly less quality. Just like at a concert, you have to check the products out because the vendor gets the shirts from many different sources. The Delta brand shirts were of higher quality but for the price I have nothing to complain about. It's not like I spent 45 ",0
Loved the product as well as packaging. Will order more and continuously. Thank you ����,0

"The women's sizes are WAY off!!!! I wear a 2X, and ordered a 3X, and it is WAY TOO TIGHT to even put on!! It is also really short!? (and I am a short woman!) I was looking forward to having a matching shirt to my husband and son, but couldn't choose the red that they had picked as it wasn't available in the women's sizes. The men's shirts are fine- standard men's sizing and quality, but a TOTAL miss on the women's side. Too bad. I would have ordered more.",3

All the wording is flaking and has large gaps. I do not have time to reorder Before Christmas so I needed to send it to my granddaughter the way it is. Really like the T-shirt just disappointed in the art,3
The picture on the website looked to bright and pretty in the sweatshirt which is why I choose to spend the extra money and buy it here and pay for shipping which I never do.... the sweatshirt I received the picture was super light and faded looking. Defiantly disappointment in my purchase.,3
My order was correct no problems,6
The designs on the tank tops I ordered are too low. The placement used to be better. Very disappointed. It seems there is a new company making the shirts since I last got them(Bella canvas?) and they may be the reason.,3

This was a gift. It was SO LATE that the recipient has not received it. I still feel I was misled to bordering on lies about item being shipped. I asked for a full refund but only the shipping cost were refunded. Please print this because I deserve my right to warn others. This right is being denied unless I allow cookies. These cookies are blackmail. I will hit I agree. I will also send to twitter and Facebook.,6

"Nice shirt but I ordered a XXL because I thought they would run small. My 14 year old niece can barely get it on. Whatever size you need, go up 3 levels. Cannot wear it, so dissapointed",3
It took too long to get product and once I got it they ran 3 sizes smaller than normal. I ordered 3 shirts and I usually wear a small and the xlarge fit me. I asked for an exchange but no reply yet. Two of these were for Xmas gifts for friends. Does not look like I'm going to be able to get them in time. Besides your 3x is the largest you offer and runs too small for my 2x friend. Terribly disappointed. Would like my money back.,3

"I have ordered from tee public several times. the last two occasions were disappointing. First, I ordered two tee's the same size and got two very different sizes. I was somewhat satisfied that i was sent the correct size in a reasonable amount of time... then I ordered 9 tee's on Thanksgiving... and received them on DECEMBER 24... after repeated calling and asking where they were. Too late to send them anywhere, too late to even get them to their intended folks who were traveling at that point. we had to wait until the weekend after christmas to get them to people. VERY DISAPPOINTING. It was a whole MONTH to get my order.RE: Samuals response- I did exactly as you said and then had to follow up with *two* different people who said exactly the same thing that they did before, that they just couldn't help that shipping took a MONTH to get to me and that they couldn't do anything. HOWEVER, all my amazon stuff got here on time, with accurate shipping, and with a LOT MORE reliability. Woot Shirt is now owned by amazon, which is your competitor, so you might want to think about less excuses on MONTH LONG SHIPPING and the responses you gave.after being told to recontact customer service and getting the runaround and then platitudes about being given the runaround (when i did not even ask to be reconnected to customer service), i deleted a star from my review because of poor customer service... which IS something that this company can control.",3

"This is my second time ordering back to school shirts. This year, all of the images are blurry and the black ink is dark grey. One of the yellow shirts is pastel - not the yellow advertised. Guess I'll blame COVID?The large shirts I ordered last year were perfect, the XL shirts this year are all disappointing. I'm glad that my son doesn't care that much... They have a guarantee to fix errors, but I don't want to be bothered with returns and refunds. I gave 2 stars (instead of one) because all 8 shirts came in the same shipping bag and they're soft.",3

"I ordered a sweatshirt and when it arrived I was immediately disappointed. From the website of TeePublic I was under the impression of the icons on their website that the product would have been DTG screened/printed and instead it appears to be an iron on decal. Also, the decal was not completely filled in. When I reached out to the company they only addressed the issue of, what appears to be a poorly attached decal as saying the artist was making it look ""distressed"" so even if replacing it too would not have full ink coverage in the lettering. With this ""distressing"" as they call it makes it look quite amateur. Lesson learned.",3
Super simple website with tons of choices. I purchased 14 Tee shirts and everyone was exactly as ordered.Shipping was prompt and the whole experience was seemless.Thanks!,0
"Love the creative designs that encompass almost any and everything. The trees, hoodies, and the baseball tees are all high quality and durable. Where else can you find Muppets reenacting Anton Chigrin strangling a cop in No Country for Old Men and a Free Palestine hoodie in purple on the same site. Delivery is prompt and they keep in the loop from the time you order until it's at your front door. Great company for undiscovered artists. Thank you",0

"Hi. I was very happy to find the products on your site! However, the order took longer than anticipated and is coming in 2 shipments. The items that we ordered, mug, pins (and the t-shirts haven't arrived yet) had the saying It's A Johnny Thing - you wouldn't understand.The word ""understand"" is barely legible on the mug and pins...I am waiting for the t-shirts to arrive and hope I'm not disappointed in the legibility on those. We also ordered Team Johnny - Lifetime member and those were very easy to read. The shipping was quite expensive but I know that's not your fault. But for $33, I would think I would have the products in hand by now. But still waiting on the 2nd part which is the t-shirts. Thanks for asking! Angie Brohm",0

Ordered wrong size shirts but with an email the problem was corrected and within a week received the the perfect fit. Thanks so much!! You���������ve got my five stars ,0
Design is brilliant on both t-shirts. The major disappointments is the massive shrinkage and thinness of the fabric. They can't be worn so I guess I have to make them into pillows.,3
"Wow! The quality of these t shirts is unreal! Great creativity!! Great shirt feel and fit!! Screen printing quality is outstanding!! Washed shirts several times and no fading whatsoever!! Really impressed!! Only downside was price for shipping, just remember the more you buy, the better the shipping costs. I am gonna order 4 more now! Thanks so much!",0

"High cotton quality, soft, comfy feel, size chart accurate, graphics crisp and clear. Cheers, Thanks!",0
"My mistake was I thought the shirt said That 70s Show and not That 70s Shirt.So that's my mistake.But my two star rating is because the design is way, way too low.I'm six foot two and the bottom almost tucks in to my pants.That of course means the design starts much too far below the collar.There's a big space between the color and the start of the design.Probably just how I feel and not anyone else, but I'm pretty disappointed.It's too complicated to return it but it will be good for wearing around the house - but not out and about.",3
Very happy! My shirt arrived promptly in perfect condition.,1
"The shirt was a gift. It came two sizes too small. I was satisfied that the soft shirt was actually soft. However, this birthday present is now going to be used as a winter shirt for her dog, instead of a cool shirt she could wear everywhere. I was disappointed.",3

So it made sense when I found out it was a men's medium lol) I emailed them about this issue and they rectified it immediately. Both times the shipping was fast andcustomer service was superb. YT sellers should switch to this website. Because Teespring takes 4 times longer to print and ship (example, I ordered something from them a week before I ordered my item from Teeplace and I am still waiting for my merch from them.) I would definitely order from this website again. Thanks!",0
"Half of my order has not arrived and the track my shipment button in the confirmation email indicates that the shipping company has no record of it.Edit:After review, I received the other half of my order and now have all intended items. Thank you.",0
Hank you so much for your amazing TSHIRTS!,0
I love it I got it quick and came out very nice thank u .,0
It took a long time to receive my order because it was repeatedly sent to a nonexistent address. I corrected this multiple times and only on 4th correction did I get part 2 of my order. That's the bad. Your team stayed at it ( I had gave up) till I received my order and that is commendable. Thanks. That is why I would shop with you again.,0
Got exactly what I order and it arrived quickly!Good job guys. Thanks.,0
Thanks I love it. I���������ll ,0

This company has the best customer service I have ever experienced. They replaced a shirt for me at no cost that was not their mistake. I will 100% be a returning customer. Thanks Guys!!,0
"I like the art, but the quality of the printing wasn't that good. I can see the printing border from the shirt. Also, even it is a new printing, but the color looks faded and blurry already. I ordered custom shirts from other companies, and their color were much richer and printing border wasn't showing so clear. Art was good, but disappointed on the printing.",3
The shirt was awesome just not the correct size. Thank you for promptly taking care of it. Will recommend.,0
"They were bought as Christmas gifts and all I can say is Thank You.You helped make this gift was a success, and I thought girls could be tough to please.",0
"Even though they set expectations saying I may not receive it by Christmas, I received it on Christmas Eve-- Very happy!Thank you",0
I ordered a size 2xL hoping to wear it after I had shoulder surgery..Problem is its NOT a size 2XL which I was upset its rather a size m which I cant wear.Truly disappointed for I was so hoping to have it the size I ordered to I could wear it after op ( I wanted a true 2XL so I could pull it over my sling ),3
Good quality and speedy delivery. Thank you.,0

Gorgeous artwork! Love it thank you!,0
"Our t shirt got lost in the mail or picked up by someone else. But I got another one for free and mailed within 3 days of complaint! Good quality,just what we needed! Thanks!",0
I enjoy the service and quality of your product. The only problem is shipping. I receive notification of arrival. Turns out the the item is somewhere in the system (I know it���������s out of your control) However,1
The only thing is that I did receive the shirt. I ordered a Womens plus size 3X because I know shirts shrink. Your company sent me a shirt with a 3x tag but its more like a reg large. So very disappointed that I will not be able to wear what would have been my favorite Christmas shirt. I will keep it because I'm disabled and going to go return a package is painful. I probable will make a pillow cover with It instead. Your items must be made in China. I cannot put out a good word for your company and will not use you again.,3
I was disappointed in the quality and the sizing. These shirts were more expensive than other shirts ordered from other places and the quality was not as good.I would like a refund,3

Awesome T shirts! Perfect sizing and great quality. Thank you!,0
Disappointed with the quality of the product.,3
I ordered t shirts for Apashe concert and am very pleased they came early and in time for the event. Very happy,1
"The t-shirt I received is a huge disappointment and total waste of money.It's an XXL that is actually sized like a Medium.It's thin, cheap cotton material.It's maroon with black lettering and the lettering doesn't even show up at all.it has white graphics on it that are too small to make out unless you are right on top of the person.It's just overall a horrible design esp for the color of t-shirt that I chose.She will never wear it.",3
Was worried about ordering from FB especially close to Christmas but arrived quickly. Love it! Thanks!,0
"I have ordered many t-shirts from TeePublic. I usually can find a sale on designs I like and plenty of sizing choice. Also, the t-shirts are always good quality and last thru many washings.My one complaint is that while browsing around, you often have to slog thru a certain amount of crude/offensive designs. However-This being America and due to the fact that I support freedom of thought and speech, I highly recommend shopping at TeePublic. Support the artists you love/agree with and politely allow the others to express their views.",6
"The T-shirt arrived today, it's well made, a good fit and is comfortable to wear. Shipping took a little longer than usual, but it isn't usual right now, so that's okay. Happy with the purchase - thanks.",0

"The TeePublic shirts are so well made and I get a ton of compliments on them. I have bought so many for myself and family. So many different ones to pick from and I can now take my favorite classic movies and TV shows with me wherever I go! People love my Princess Bride, Wing Chun, Breakfast Club, Johnny 5, Macho Man and Godzilla versus ET. Thank you to all the talented and creative artists who made it happen. Blessings, Iron Chef Morgan",0

Yours products are without my expected! I think that tees fabric are quite thin and the figure printed are extremely colorless. Very disappointed.,3

"I ordered a t-shirt for my grandson, hoping the size was correct.When I gave it to him on his birthday, it was too small.I requested a size change on the TeePublic website on 9/11, and got a response 9/13, verifying my request.I was told that I didn't even have to send the original t-shirt back, saving me the hassle and expense of a return!They even sent it to my grandson's address, which was different from the original order.The new shirt was shipped out 9/16, and my grandson loved the new shirt!He wore it to school the next day.Thank you for making this a hassle free experience!",0
The website with the photos and detailsfor sizing is really helpful. The options for shirt styles are great. I also got my order much earlier than the days quoted which was great! :)This was an excellent customer experience for me because of these things! Thank you!,0
Always am so happy to get my items from T. Never had a problem. And the originality is the best,1
Sizing runs QUITE small. And t-shirt quality is very thin.Slightly disappointed:(,3
Update****. TeePublic has a new T-shirt coming my way.Too early to say for sure but I���������m sure this one will be perfect!Thank you so much for the quick response to my issue.I just received my Irish Cat Lovers St Patrick���������s Day T-shirt by designready4you and part of the design has transferred to the left side of the T-shirt.It came to me looking like I have a black stain on my BRAND NEW T-SHIRT.I spent $27.68 on a T-shirt I cannot and will not wear to a 5k walk/run I bought this particular T-shirt for.Ugh.I am reaching out to TeePublic to see if ,0
"I made two mistakes on my first order. I ordered seven shirts. I meant to order six. I meant to order one shirt with a 2x. I emailed them and asked them if they would exchange One of the t-shirts from 1X to a 2X. And then I would return the other one since I meant to only order one. Instead of them making me return both t-shirts, they sent me a new shirt in a size 2x, and then sent me another shirt of my choice with a different design. No questions asked. No hassle. No exchange difficulties. Customer forever. I got more than my money's worth. Have gotten nothing but good press and responses about my t-shirts from the people that see me wear them. Thanks������",0

"Really can't think of anything negative to say.The designs are original, they are beautiful,and the shirt itself is comfortable.Seem to be well made and they fit according to the size nicely.If there is a problem, and it is minor, there is a slight odor of vinegar right out of the delivery bag.I'm assuming that has to do with the screening process and will be gone upon first washing.Nothing but praise from this very satisfied customer!Thanks for everything.",0

Easy to order. Huge selection. Great sizing pics for body types.One problem: pre-shrunk? Nope. My kids shirts shrank from a youth L to a 5t in one wash. So disappointed. I guess you need to buy an adult S for a skinny 11yr old?,3
"Website was easy to navigate. Product exactly as described. Received in good time, even with the COVID delays. I'll shop there again, definitely.",6
"Tee Public!!!!!! I must say I am always skeptical about online purchases especially when it comes to buying items to wear. I bought T-Shirts and masks from help from the reviews on sizes.

Recent experience has been excellent! THANK YOU!!!,0

Very disappointed that when I received the sweat shirt the lettering match the color of the sweat shirt so that you were unable to see anything you would think that the artists would have realized this and adjusted the color accordingly,3

Just what I expected. Quick delivery. Very happy.,1
"I would have given 5 stars but I find it very difficult to navigate your page. I type in a specific name or item I'm looking for and hundreds of options come up that have nothing to do with what I'm looking for. Also the way shirts are packged in the bubble envelopes, alot of the time they place them logo on logo so when you want to see them you have to pull them apart and sometimes the logo comes off. I will continue to order i just hope in the future something can be done. Just my opinion of course.Thank you",0
"3 out of the 4 shirts were great. However, the v-neck womans tee i bought was supposed to be a two x it looks more like a medium and i will not be able to wear it,which is a shame because i was really looking forward to it.",3

Honestly amazing!!!!Thank you!!!,0
I like the design offered and I picked. A suggestion that would make specific items better would be to have an option to have print located or positioned higher on shirt. This would allow shirt to be worn tucked and not cover lower part of print or design. Thanks.,0
Tee shirt is good quality! It is also true to size ! I got it in a couple of days ! Thank you!,0
Great shirt. Thanks,0
Wonderful product and shipping!! Thank you!!,0
"Today I received my ""Keep Calm and...Relax on Hammock! T-Shirt, Keep Calm T-ShirtDesign by BluedarkArt"". I'm very pleased with the results of the artwork by the artist which is on the front of the Heather Gray classic t-shirt I chose and stands out beautifully. There is no doubt in my mind that I will order more t-shirts in the future from TeePublic. I am definitely recommending this company for t-shirts to family and friends. Communication with TeePublic customer service representatives by way of email we're very good when I had questions or changes to my order.Thank you TeePublic and BluedarkArt.",0
"Great design, great price, love the shirt. Thank you so much. Five star service.",0
"Was ok. Shirt quality was fine, but seemed like an iron on decal.",6
Excellent quality and fast shipping. Thank you much!,0
"My first package was guaranteed before Christmas and never came. They did re send the package, but it got here weeks later. I was also disappointed by the printing quality.",3
"Product is amazing. Exactly what I ordered. Shipping was quick. I had ordered a shirt that was too small, I emailed that I needed an exchange and the same day I was notified that a new shirt was coming. Costumer service is awesome!Thank you so much TeePublic for the excellent service and products. I will definitely recommend to anyone that is looking for a different and great gift.",0
The colors and detail are awesome. Quality exceeds expectations.Thank you.,0
"A great product--just the message I've been looking for--Veganism Means Justice--on soft, comfortable material, and fast shipping! Thank you!",0
Easy to order. Great product. I ordered nerdy shirts and am enjoying wearing them!,1
"The tee is cute.I can't speak to quality as it was a gift and went directly to recipient.But the shirt was ordered on 2 June 2020 and meant for the 4th of July.It arrived on Sunday, 12 July, six weeks after the initial order/payment. There were no shipping/tracking notifications.(Even the pandemic can't be blamed for that kind of a delivery delay.)The lack of communication and the inordinate delivery time were disappointing, to say the least.Without assurances of a more timely delivery it's unlikely that I'll be ordering from TeePublic again",3
"I ordered a tshirt for my friend for christmas and when it arrived, i was very pleased with the product.",1
I have purchased a few t shirts good quality and fast delivery. A wide rangeof sizes. I am very pleased.Thanks Laurie,0

"Sweatshirts were fine, but disappointing service. I ordered sweatshirts Dec 4th, and 9th. It didn���������t occur to me to rush delivery because it was early. It is now Dec 24th and I need to leave for Christmas Eve without my nephews gift. When I asked about my shipments on the latest day they were supposed to arrive all I got was a generic email stating it would be there soon. 10 days later still nothing. I understand Christmas is busy but from what I can tell it didn���������t ship for 5-7 days after ordered it and tha",3

"I gave an excellent for the design, the quality of the shirt, and the way you picture real people wearing the different sizes.For one shirt it worked out great, but the second one sizing was off.The first kind I took an XL butthe one with the Cars Night Thoughts Podcast, the XL was way too big.But that kind of stuff happens with other companies as well. For $13.00 a shirt, I am not complianing.Thanks for this service.",0

Thank you very much love the shirts definitely gonna have to get more,0
"I received an item with a very bad graphic print quality. So I contact the customer service that was really nice (only reason why I gave 2 stars instead of 1). They sent me a new t-shirt for free, however the t-shirt came with the same defect. Low quality print full of black points on the image. Unfortunately I did not have a good experience on my first shop with TeePublic.",3
I���������m really enjoying my new T-Shirt!Can�������,1
I made plenty of orders though TeePublic. And that right there says it all. Very happy with everything. Big Thanks,0
There was no update given on the status of order when it was shipped only when it was delivered. The description of the product would make you think the quality would be nice but it���������s mediocre. Sizing was the worse. I purchased the XL but It does not fit at all the base lift up and is way to short. So disappointed for spending $50 for a hoodie ,3
"Thanks a lot, cool artwork <3",0
I have a few World of Walt T-shirts that I got from TeePublic. And I have never been disappointed. Thanks!!!,0

"This is the best and most reliable site to order custom shirts from not only are they dope the quality is awesome too, oh did I mention there customer service is impeccable. My order was lost by the Courier and I emailed them, and bam 10 mins later emailed me back saying another package is being made and will be shipped asked if there was any better place to ship my package to and after maybe 25mins most everything was resolved and I certainly will be promoting this site but also buying more awesome clothes thanks for being A1",0

Great products! Fast service!Thanks!,0
Great shirt! My brother loved it! Thanks,0
"Flawless experience. Customer support was front loaded in case of issue. Tracking and shipping notices provided, packet received quickly, and product was perfect. Printer used Next Level shirts which I prefer (over Bella Canvas which have been irregular.) Thanks!",0
This is a company that cares about customers and not just increasing their profit line. Ordered a t-shirt for my sister and was too small. They gave me an exchange for a larger size and told me to donate the first shirt. Donated it to a church group (Spread Hope Now) to someone who needed clothes.The shirt represented the new puppy named Sunshine. It will always be a reminder to her of the sunshine people can share in their lives. Thank you all,0
"Website was easy to navigate.Ordering was easy and communication and timing of delivery was great.I did expect a bit more from the quality of design from the picture on the site, but otherwise very happy with the purchase.Many thanks!",0
"I love being able to support artists by buying and wearing their art. My only issue with this platform is how expensive shipping is! Most of the time, the shipping costs just as much (if not more) than the actual product.... disappointing. But overall I like the choice of designs and will most likely buy again.",3
I was really looking forward to this shirt for my son. But unfortunately the print on the shirts looks super faded. The colors are dul and not vibrant at all. It looks like this shirt is like 3 years old !!!,3
"I found the shirts I ordered to be exactly as I seen I on the website. I also ordered my wife a medium (that���������s what she wears) they didn���������t fit. Didn���������t realize she wears a large in ladies cut shirts, which is what I ordered. This amazing company sent me the correct size with no problems. Thank you TeePublic. I recom",0
On-time great quality. Redline Bmx Shirt is really cool. Thanks,0
The company was very responsive and generous. Will definitely be my first choice in having custom clothing items made! Thanks!,0
"I ordered a black The tempo is what I say it is T, paid for brushed soft cotton, what I received was the absolute thinnest low quality t shirt I���������ve every seen. You can clearly see through it just standing in low light. Print feels like it won���������t last more than 1 or two washes if the actual tee even lasts long enough to wash. Misleading info, I was expecting a soft brushed cotton, what I received is junk. I���������m waiting to hear back from customer service, sent pics of what I received, don���������t know how they���������ll choose to resolve but I paid full price for a dollar store quality tee, extremely disappointedUpdate: customer service response was good, they recommended a different material/weight & told me to donate the horrible one. I still don���������t know what new o",3
Received my order. Print was nothing like I expected. It was small and washed out. Looks like it was ironed on. Disappointed.,3
"When I ordered the original T shirt I assumed I would have to go bigger. This was not the case. I asked about changing for a smaller size. This was not a problem, with a week it was replaced by the smaller size. I would recommend TEE PUBLIC to everyone I speak to. Thank you",0
"This is where I want to shop, I've been hoodwinked too many times by other sellers, the response and delivery time was on point and the product was unique and of excellent quality, thank you Tee Public",0
The t-shirts turned out great! Thank you.,0
The customer service I received was excellent but the product I received is terrible. The first one I received was so incredibly small I requested a replacement. I received a replacement but the ink was so faded it was as though the printer ran out of ink. For $25 plus taxes I would Expectbetter quality. I did not attempt another replacement. I am left disappointed.,3
The T-shirt I purchased was of extremely low quality.The printing was faded and the material is practically see-through.Very disappointed,3
A great way to represent my Army unit - Thanks,0
More ink was needed for the screen on the t-shirt so it looks very streaky. I can also see the color of the shirt through the design. Disappointed.,3
I would definitely recommend this to others. My clothes came early and they were the perfect size. I will be shopping from you guys again. Thank you for the great service.,0
The purple print was not of consistent color it is streaky in a few spots. That is not good.,4
Love the tshirts received. Thanks!,0
"Came quickly and was exactly what I wanted. The quality was excellent, and so much to choose from, thank you!!!",0
Great craftsmanship on product ordered before Christmas! Very pleased! Thanks,0
I want to give a huge thanks for the customer service I received for an exchange.They were very quick to respond and sent the new size promptly.I only wish we could return for refund or store credit rather than exchange only.As the exchange did not work for me either.,0
I love my blake griffin tee. It's super soft & I love the detail and color. Thanks again!,0
"Great shirt, fast ship!! Thank you!",0
Love and support all theses artists.Love what they do to re-invent key moments from film for t shirts and masks and mugs. Thanks to all of your brilliant artistry.,0
"I still love the tapestry, it was just a lot less vibrant than the picture led to believe which was a little disappointing. Awesome art though",3
Got the wrong size as a Christmas gift. Tried to exchange and they made it so easy and just sent us a new shirt the size we needed. Def buying from again. The decal on the shirt was high quality. Thank you!,0
I ordered 2 t shirts that has a print of a half dome from yosemite national park. The prints are off centered. Very disappointed.,3
The note to upsize if this is your fit and this is your style most ppl upsize by one If you usually wear a size an XL go with the XXL I. This style and material and that alone saved this whole experience.I purchased 4 shirts and having to send them back would have ruined the experience. Thank for the foot note that saved it all.,0
"Got a great deal on the shirts, they showed up earlier than expected and higher quality than I expected. Thanks guys nicely done!",0
"Ordered my sister her birthday present and it never showed.. the postal service was responsible for that.. but when I contacted TeePublic and told them, they immediately shipped another shirt for me and I am so grateful for that!

"I ordered several tees as gifts. I made a mistake and ordered a women's sized tee for one of the gifts and when I received, I knew right away that it wasn't going to work. I contacted TeePublic and within an hour, very late on a Saturday evening, my problem was resolved and they got my new size on order and ready to ship. I received the new size and am thrilled with the speed and professionalism with which my problem was handled. It is almost impossible to find customer service like this anymore. Thank you TeePublic for the awesome customer service!",0
Very nicely done. Thank you,0
My nephew is in love with his T-shirt thank u so much,0
Cute graphics and super soft tees.Very happy with my purchase!,1
"Edit: the reply I got mentioned nothing about my complaint that it is focused around Xmas. Downgrading to one star. While I appreciate the pandemic restrictions, communication about my order and timeliness of my delivery was disappointing. They said ""don't worry, it will be there by Christmas"" and we are a Jewish family. Chanukkah ends on Thursday evening, 12/17, and I ordered a hoodie in hopes my child could receive it on time. This was well within the original delivery window. I am more upset about the Christonormative communication than anything else.",3
"The t-shirts I ordered did arrive as ordered and advertised.My only ""critique"" is that the shipping time seemed awfully long (almost 2 weeks).But I'm happy with the t-shirts!",1
i received my order and will say i was a little disappointed the large fits more like a sm-edium.,3

Super affordable and very fast delivery. The soft tee shirts really are super soft. Definitely size up in the women's fit- they state 1-2 sizes up from your usual size and I fully agree.,6
We love our shirts. Great shipping. Thanks for everything!!,0
Great job on the shirt . Thanks for being so helpful and kind. In these days we can use good companies like yours . Keep up the good work,0

"I was looking for a specific t-shirt as a gift for my son-in-law's birthday. When he received it, he was not only excited by the quality, going on and on about how beautiful it was, but was surprised I was able to find a shirt with the exact make, model and color of his collector car. Thank you so much!",0
I love TeePublic-great shirts and unbeatable customer service in a world that barely offers it anymore-thanks all!,0
Tshirts are a little flimsy and designs show up much better online than the actual tshirt.Still waiting for a complete delivery.I ordered 5 tshirts and 1 has still not arrived.I���������m a little disappointed.UPDATE:I received my Late order and am actually very pleased with this one.Design was very nice and tshirt,3

"I needed a Christmas gift and was running out of time. Tee Public had the perfect T-shirt for my son, and it arrived in plenty of time and as described. Thanks, TeePublic!",0
"Ordered a large and extra large, and the tees were more like a small and a medium. Ordered for St Patrick's Day, with no time to re-order from somewhere else! Very disappointed!",3
The sizes are all wrong!! Way way too small than all the t shirts we have ever bought!!,4
Great shirt!!!! I love it and I put it on as soon as I got it. Thank you so much!!!,0
Hoodies were well received by my family.The originality was noticed and appreciated.Thanks midcenturydave!,0
My product arrived in a timely fashion. It was a quality product and fit to the exact size. I would definitely recommend this company and look forward to shopping with them again in the future. Thanks.,0
I love the designs but don't love the tee shirts. The quality of the shirts are poor. The artists I've ordered from do not use heavy duty tees. There should be a code or some sort of rule set by the site for designers to follow. You should not be allowed to sell if you are not going to provide quality tee shirts.,4
My Grandson was really happy to get the t-shirt! It came out very nice! They sent me a picture of it. I was very pleased!,1
"Hello, I received my order a couple of days ago Thank you, however I just feel a few changes can be made. The first one is the quality (material) of the shirt could be thicker and secondly the print (wording) could be a little darker. Other than that I am pleased with my order. Thank you again.",0
"To whom it may concern,I acquired about your product specifically because it was both a racer blue in color, and it was from an independent merchant. However, what I received was not ""racer blue"" in color, but instead a strongly faded version of what was advertised. Saddened to say my experience as a first time customer here was not a very pleasant one. I look forward to your response.Thanks,",0
"Overall I certainly like the shirt and the design. However, the graphic faded significantly after the 1st time I washed it and the quality of the shirt itself seems a little bit cheesy for a $30 tee shirt. I would recommend that the seller considers higher quality tee shirts in the future if the price point is going to be so high. Thank you",0
This is the perfect gift! It came on time and in great condition. Thank you!,0
I got my package pretty quickly and the quality was amazing!! Thanks so much!,0
I appreciate the customer service you provided in notifying me that you would send larger sizes of the tshirts I ordered. It is quite a relief to know that they were sent. Thank you,0
"Thank you, its great",0
Items ordered were correct. Came on time. Everything was as expected,6
Very fast delivery; thank you!,0
Received a quality shirt with accurate logo in short period of time. Thanks!,0
"There was a totally understandable issue with my order. This meant that received the wrong size shirts.When I notified TeePublic about it, I received a professional, responsive, respectful and quick resolution.Replacement shirts were sent out immediately.I have received them and I am very happy with my purchase.Thank you TeePublic for being a reliable company that stands by your promises.I would absolutely recommend you again in the future!",0
"The shirt is extremely comfortable and the material is very soft. Absolutely love the design, will be back for more. Thank you!",0
"Great item, good quality. The only thing that I was disappointed with was shipping. My original order took a month to get here. I had emailed because it had not arrived by the specified date and another was sent. I received the original order one day before the replacement.",3
"Beautiful shirts, perfect fit!Kids love them!!THANKS!",0
The designs were fine.The impression that both shirts would be from the same manufacturer...and therefore the same color...was highly misleading on the website.Extremely disappointed. Will never use Tee Publics again.,3
Shirts turned out great!! Delivery was quick! Thank you,0
"The design I purchased was very cool! Love his work. I was pleased that the shirt itself was a Bella+Canvas. The print itself was not great. The print was streaky, like when an inkjet printer is running out of ink. Not enough to send it back, but a little bit disappointing.",3
Just got my order.Def pretty happy to see how everything turned out.1 out of 15 shirts ordered were the wrong color but I'm not sweating it. Was exactly what I was hoping for.,1
"Once again , great product at a good price with consistentshipping time. Thank you",0
It came quickly and exactly as described!!! The colors are spot on and I am over the moon happy with my purchase.,1
I am a high fan of digital sky podcast and I am very happy with the design and quality of my face mask.,1

Sizing runs extremely small. I bought one size bigger than I normally wear and this thing won't fit me unless I lose at least 30lbs. I am still waiting for one item from my order from over a month ago. The gift exchange I got it for was 3 days ago. To say I am disappointed would be an understatement.,3

"The print was not clear and firm on looking, it is quiet disappointing receive after nearly a month.Shipping mode is way too slow for international",3
I ordered 2 premium tee's and the material was thinner than regular tee's I have ordered in the past. I assumed premium meant a heavier more quality tee. Needless to say I am very disappointed.,3
"Great selection, fair prices, great communication regarding our order and fast shipping! We are very happy with the t shirt and the hoodie we ordered!",1
The quality was a little disappointing. It was almost like the image was to small to begin with to be made so big. They needed a bigger file. Also the smell was nuts,3

"I gave this only 3 stars..design was GREAT but the quality of the Tee shirt itself was not. VERY thin material and will probably shrink when washed. I bought the Bizarro shirt for my grandson's birthday, he is not a child but a grown man so it is even more disappointing to have this to give him. This was first time ordering from TeePublic and I do not know at this time if I will be a repeat customer.",3

Perfect experience ordered wrong size. They immediately sent the next size up. Thank you so much.,0
The size is not true to size. I bought a man's extra large but fits like a woman's large. The material is very thin and can see right through it. The print looks nothing like it did in the picture. Very poor quality.The only reason I gave two stars is the shipping was quick. Actually should have only gave one start. Very disappointed in this purchase.,3
Awesome quality shirts. Thank you ����,0
You guys came through when another company let me down . My order came quickly and the shirt I ordered is so soft ! You have got a fan for life . Thanks again,0

"I bought a Minnesota Moose sweatshirt for my son for christmas and we are very disappointed in the quality.

What they advertise online is not the product they send out. Products look great online and then what you receive is a subpar flawed version of the online representation. Do not recommend.,4

"I was very disappointed by the artwork of the ""Inverted Jenny"" t-shirt that was received. The poor quality might not have been as glaring if there were not 3 other shirts of a similar theme.When all 4 were lined up, the others had crisp details.The Inverted Jenny is so fuzzy that it appears to have been printed on a furry blanket rather than a t-shirt.It is a large design on a large shirt (4X), but unfortunately, it just looks like a cheap product.One of the other shirts has a single stamp, ""Penny Black"", but its design is sharp and clear.If you send a subsequent survey, I will give the other 3 shirts the 5 stars they earned.",3
"Helpful customer service! Finally got a shirt replacement. The first one came awful, faded colors, missing parts of the print and very noticeable print lines. The new shirt unfortunately came after Christmas but it's okay since the friend go covid so I couldn't visit. But the new shirt came and it's perfect condition! Washed it cause the usual tees smell of vinegar and ready for my friend to open cause he loves horror movies. Thank you!",0

"Sometimes everything is fine, but other times I receive my shirts with peeling on the print. As well the print on the hoodies are too small. Making the print a little larger won���������t get it anywhere close to the pocket on the hoodies as the fine print suggests in the description. I enjoy the wide range of options available.

I was then disappointed to see that the order was being fulfilled by a third party. I was then further disappointed that to begin shipping took several days.

"The designs are really nice and there are loads of great artists!However, the T-shirts quality have gone downhill for several years now. I usually order several T-shirts every 2 years for the past 6 years. And the quality of the fabrics used is getting worse and worse. 2 years ago, I had already noticed how thin the shirts were, but it was still acceptable.The last order, received yesterday, is just a complete disappointment. For example: a white Tee with fabric so thin you can see through, the other Tees that should be handwashed as it's already streched with one wash in machine (gentle wash, cold!!).Like I said, great design, awesome artists, horrible fabric quality.I think this will be my last order. Let's see if Teepublic manages to make better shirts quality.",3

Happy to find my daughter's favorite characters on T-shirts.These long agoand far away memories have come back to life.,1
I did not get my items in time - I throughly read the shipping information. I even contacted customer service right after the order was placed.Stated that I had to have the items by the 24th - and asked was that possible.Response was they would make shipping method changes and sent me a PayPal Invoice which I paid immediately.My shirts were delivered AFTER my event - On October the 28th - 4 days after I should have received them.Disappointed is an understatement.,3
"I bought this for a Christmas gift for a friend.I know you may think this is odd, but she has been diagnosed with a liver disease.I wanted to make sure she got it.She opened it, and was thrilled.Thank you for helping me make that little girls day.Cheryl",0
Shirts came out amazing! Shipping took a little longer this time but I���������m very happy,1
Shirt is high quality. Impressed. Artwork on shirt came out very well and it is exactly as I expected. Thank you!,0
Took much longer than expected for my order to arrive. Also the printing of one of the designs is not as nice as it appears online - the colours aren't as bold and there's a white outline which looks like a mistake was made while printing. The design looks much cleaner online. In real life it looks a little smudgy :(,3
"I found the exact T-shirt I was looking for (not available anywhere else), and it arrived quicker than I thought. Looks and fits great, and reasonably priced. Thank you!",0
This is not what I ordered and I ordered 2 day shipping 19.99 didn't get that either,4

"What can I say.I ordered two t shirts, my normal xl size.The shirts were a bit large for me and with no questions you shipped two large shirts at no cost to me.Highest quality, service and customer relations.Thank you.",0
"The shirts I ordered (classic T's) are as fantastic as they used to be on my first ever order. The material that's used is one of my favorites, and to top it off; The custom designs are in the best quality. I'm looking forward to ordering more in the future when there is a 30% sale. I understand the extra cost to make larger shirts, so, it's good to be able to purchase them at a normal price when the sales are up. Thank you for doing these specials!",0
The sizes are way off. The women's are way too small and the men's are way too big. The colors don't match for men's and women's even though the same color was ordered. Very disappointed.,3

"Pins were very low quality. All four were off-center, and one was even lumpy. Zero quality control.The print quality on the shirts was poor, but I have come to expect that from print-on-demand (although it is even worse this time than with past purchases).

"The design of the T-shirt was great and appears to be good quality which contrast with the quality of the Tee chosen to print on which was poor.So, a suggestion is to chose abetter cut quality shirt. It had narrow shoulders and wide trunk (wired cut or it could be a women cut? Idk). Thanks!",0

Spent over $100 in what I hoped would be a awesome set of tshirts for my 18m old son and every one of the shirts came in looking like really poor quality silk screening /printing for the amount spent. Each image looked like copies of a copy of a copy and even after that looked like they lost color and detail after about 5 years worth of washing. I'd return them but I doubt the results of those efforts would produce better products. Better to learn the lesson and just let folks know that they won't be receiving what the website shows. Very disappointing.,3
My shipment arrived in good shape good quality and timelyfashion.Thanks for not letting me down!,0
"Nice timely delivery. Very nice job on finishing same. Haven't washed it yet, but I will advise you later if I have any problems. I don't anticipate any problems.If you have any special offers or coupons please keep me advised. Overall, It looks like you have a nice product.Thank YouiAZ",0

Overpriced and poor quality of tshirt. There is odd discoloring on the back of the shirt - poor workmanship or the printers? The shirt is all ready pilling and I just got it today - haven't even washed it yet. I'm very disappointed. This was a special birthday gift for my son.,3

Some times takes a bit long to get things. But overall very happy with the product when it does arrive.,1

The printing is very poor. You can see the material through the print. The Lebron prins look worn. You can barely see the Taco Tuesday letters. I am very disappointed.,3
Looks great. Relatively quick fulfillment and shipping considering the holidays and current state of things. Thanks,0
I had never heard of Tee. Stumbled up on it when looking for football tshirt for my grandson. Pleasant surprise to find. At our local sports shop items are 3-4 times higher than at Teepublic. always kept informed about shipping status. Thank you tee :),0

"I was confused about the sizes, but I guess I picked the wrong size. TeePublic sent me the shirt in the right size, no problem whatsoever! Thank you!",0
"the product fit , correct fit and got it on time and oh yes price was right--- thank you",0
"I was a little disappointed with the time it took to get the shirt.I am much more disappointed with the quality of the work. There are dozens of either burns or bleeds on the edges of the printing. It looks like crap. I will take pictures tonight and submit them tomorrow.Also, this 2x size seems awful large for a 2x. I assume it'll shrink a bit after a couple washes, but pre-shrinking your shirts may be a good idea, to avoid confusion in the future.And $6.99 for shipping? C'mon....I love the idea behind the business, but the execution could use a little polish.",3

I recently purchased a Brian Jones tee shirt as a birthday gift for my BFF since high school.She was absolutely delighted with the garment and the design.I have bought several shirts from tee public and will continue to do so.Thank you!,0
"The t-shirts and sweatshirts I ordered were great and my kids love them!The only problem I have is that the printing on one of the sweatshirts I ordered was unclear and not great visual quality. It almost looks like the graphic resolution was too low and meant only for printing on smaller items.It is difficult to read on the sweatshirt, which is a big issue.This is a big disappointment for this one item.The other items, however, are perfect.",3

I enjoy the wide selection of apparel that can be ordered from TeePublic.It seems like a good site for independent artists.I like being able to find more niche options and knowing that some of the money is going to the artists.,1
"Requesting a refund as the design was incorrect/incomplete and placed crooked on the shirt. Design itself already looks cracked and faded. Shirt is also way larger than an XL. Looks more like a XXL or XXXL. It also took over 2 weeks for it to arrive to me. Very disappointed, overall.",3
While the artist used a graphic that was too small for print and sent me a shirt with terrible quailty. TeePublic took care of me after the fact with GREAT customer service. Worked with me and worked quick at it. Thank you.,0
I'm amazed at how high quality this hoodie is. Printing is beautifully done and fits perfect. Thank you.,0

I'm disappointed in how the printing came out. Very uneven coloring and a bit blurry.The company did have good customer service after the fact but unfortunately could not do a quality reprint of my item so offered me another product or refund. I opted for refund.,3

I placed an order for a bunch of Asexual Pride stuff and there was an issue with the color purple on the Asexual Pride flag on a mug I ordered. It was blue instead of purple. I contacted TeePublic and sent them a photo as proof. Danielle responded and was very polite and friendly. She told me I'd receive a new travel mug ($22 Value AFTER Halloween Sale Discount) free of charge. I'm still waiting on my stickers from them but thanks to Danielle they should have a repeat customer now. :),0

Very disappointed in my order as a whole. Even though it came in sufficient time which is the only good portion of this review. Print quality (discoloration) was bad on two of my shirts and my hoodie I ordered. Ordered over $100 worth of items. Positioning and image sizing were terrible on my two shirts (crooked and small). Bad sizing on my hoodie also. I ordered all 3XLs so imagining and quality weren't redone for my size. Great chance I wont be ordering from this site again. Super disappointed. Saw so much other stuff that looked cool and wanted to purchase.,3

"Disappointed with T-shirt.I am disappointed how bad the print looks on the shirt. The image looks great on the website. The letters are red like blood (which makes totally sense considering the movie) but on the shirt it's more of an orange. And the image itself looks like it was enlarged several times to fit the shirt and you can cleary see how pixelated it is. The quality is just bad. The shirt itself, premium T-shirt, is good quality and feels very soft and nice.",3

"Ordered a tee shirt with ""amazing dad"" wording exactly what we were looking for as a gift for our daughter .Had to wait a few weeks for delivery understanderbly as it was coming from America.Very disappointed on arrival as it wasnt the one I had ordered and the replacement sent detailed various ways of using the word"" Butts"" with various pictures of a certain part of the human anatomy.This was most inappropriate so we were quite shocked.I immediately contacted the company who unreservedlyapologised &offered a complete refund &said we could keep the goods sent .They informed me that the original order was of poor print quality so could not be used I said then maybe they should have informed me so I could cancel the order.The refund was immediately put back into my account so for that top marks. I would be a little wary of future orders but commend them for their quick response to my complaint .",3
"The shirt quality is a 5 star.I ordered a 2x and they do run very small, this is disappointing because I will not wear it this small.I LOVE the print!",3

The tees were even better in person! Nice quality shirts and graphics. Have recommended them to everyone who comments on the shirts! Thanks!,0
Purchase and delivery was outstanding. I was disappointed that the art work on the sweatshirts was done in silk screen and not with option with a stitched design. The silk screening looks to be a little light on the ink.Would be nice if they would let you if was going to be silk screen versus sewn design emblem on the web page.,3

Fast delivery & great product. Thank you!,0

"I have ordered multiple times from TeePublic, all with excellent customer service. Unfortunately, this time the shipping was much longer than usual. I understand this is not TeePublic's fault, but it caused a birthday gift to be over a week late. With the shipping information given, there was no way to really track the item, it just vaguely said it was ""on the way.""Thankfully it was eventually received and the item quality is as expected. Thank you!",0
I bought 4 tshirts. They r all beautiful. The artwork is amazing. Prices r gr8 & delivery was quick. Sizes r a little on the small side but I am extremely satisfied with my order. Sure I will be returning & tell my friends. Happy holidays & thank u!,0

Arrived pretty quickly and in good condition.Thank you!,0
The site says to order a size up because the shirts run small. I ordered an XL instead of a large and it is too small. My package arrived after what I had needed it for. The tracking information kept changing every time I checked it. Very disappointed!,3
"Ordered a t-shirt for a Christmas present on December 5 2019. Should be plenty of time for delivery from U.S. to Canada, right?Nope.Just checked the shipping status on January 2, 2020. It states that it arrived IN CANADA on December 30, 2019. It took 25 DAYS to get from East Bumf*ck, USA into Canada. Not to my house - just into Canada.One month later and I still haven't received the item intended to be a Christmas present. Maybe I can give it to the person at CHRISTMAS 2020.What a frustration. What a disappointment.",3

I purchased this pug tee shirt for my sister for Christmas. It's so hard to find tees with a black pug. And I loved I could choose the color of the tee itself. Blue is her favorite color. She absolutely loves it!! I will definitely be back to purchase another for her birthday in January. Shipping was fast and it arrived in time for Christmas. Thank you so much!,0
A little disappointed in the size. I guess I need a 2X tall rather than a3X. I don't think it will be long enough even tho it said the 3X was quite a bit longer than the 2X :( I usually get the long-tail tees from Duluth Trading.,3
Love the design. Thanks,0
"Hello, I want to testify to the excellent service I received following my order at Teepublic. Unfortunately, at the time of my order, I had not seen the wonderful Size Chart section which allows you to view the different formats.Result: the t-shirts ordered were too big.

I absolutely love my t-shirts-- thank you,0
Print not centered and very blurry. Very disappointed.,3

"I was looking for a T shirtthat was ""different"" from the normal. I found one here on TeePpublic . It was for a Dodge M37 truck. I shared it with my fellow M37 lovers and hope that helped your artist sell more of these nice T shirts. I would like to hear from the artist to know what inspired him/her to draw the original. Thanks for a good product.",0

Good quality sweat shirt and logo looks great. Received very promptly! Thanks!,0
Print quality is nice but the shirt itself ( the blank) is very very thin with a low thread count when compared to concert merch so I was a bit disappointed but again the quality of the print was good.,3

"Hi,In our initial order some of the t shirtswere too small. As we were on a time crunch I re ordered t shirts and explained our situation. The customer service was excellent. Our money was refunded for the second order and the new t shirts arrived in time for our group weekend away.We have just had our weekend away and they were a hit with the business owners and other customers on the trip asking where they could buy them.Thank you for your prompt service and turn around of our order.Regards Tracey",0

When I placed the order for a present for the boss my co-worker and I though the shipping cost $12.99 was high.We thought it was worth it though because we were getting 2 items before Christmas.Only 1 item was shipped and there isn't a status on the other item. It won't be here for Christmas which is disappointing.If we had known that it would be shipped late and not arrive before Christmas we would have ordered something else.It would be helpful if that information was provided at the time of order.The item we did receive is great! a good quality mug and clear photo on the mug.,3

I like your variety of shirts. They are a little pricey compared to other companies. After the shipping and tax I paid a lot more for a t-shirt than I usually would. Probably won't order again because of price. Enjoy the shirts I got though,1
The t shirt transfers are not the best quality. They send like the type you can iron on in your home. I love all the designs but I was not impressed by the quality.,4

"I'm so disappointed in Teepublic. I've ordered before with great results, so eagerly placed a large order for shirts for a family Disney World trip that were to be given for Christmas presents. I ordered on December 2, well before the cutoff for Christmas delivery, with standard shipping, which should have been 7-10 days. On December 20 (15 business days later) the shirts had not yet arrived, and I emailed customer service asking for help or some way to make it right. I received a response on December 24, that the shirts should be on their way, with no mention of reparations. Unfortunately I had to travel out of town for Christmas and so was unable to give my family their gifts. They were delivered on December 26. I got home on December 28 to see the results, which were also disappointing. Some shirts were fine, but others have smudges of ink on them, and the XL ones are a different shade than the S/M/L. I wrote in again that day asking for customer service to make it right, and to date have received no answer, just an invitation to review. I'm very upset and will definitely be seeking other companies for future printing needs.",3
I got the a shirt as a Christmas present for my friend. She loves it! Thank you :),0

"I purchased six T-Shirts in two orders. Very happy with the quality and delivery speed of five of them. The sixth, however, is another story. The shirt in question is: ""Mediocrates Meh Good Enough"" (Sarcasm) Designed & sold by teecloud. While the shirt itself is good quality, and I love the design, the print quality is terrible. I have run the shirt through the laundry precisely twice since I received the shirt (following the tag guidelines), and already the text is so faded it's virtually illegible. Very disappointing, especially considering the comparative quality of the other shirts I got around the same time.",3
"Good Workmanship, and Quality.. thanks!",0
"My son loves his shirt! It's a perfect fit, good quality t-shirt. Thank you so much!",0
Long wait for poor quality. Took nearly a month. Size of t-shirt did fit my son perfectly but the design was poor. He got a red shirt and some parts of the graphic were white... Well they were supposed to be white but I'm guessing cheap iron-ons + red shirt= pink. I'm disappointed. Also after one wash some of the design is missing washed it inside out to try to prevent this. Waste of time and $20,3

"Hoodie, was exactly as ordered, prompt delivery.Thanks!",0
The shirts and stuff we have ordered are great . But using UPS instead of The USPS is painful to Canada . The brokerage fees alone are brutal. We still haven't received our last order that UPS says they delivered but can't prove it . Was very disappointed as they were Christmas gifts.,3
My product arrived quickly and was good quality. I am happy with the product.,1
Easy to navigate website. Great selection. Good quality shirts with great designs. I am a returning customer and will return again. Thank you!,0
Ordered a STAN LEE /MARVEL Theme shirt and it looked very unpro! Print was very cheap looking and choppy! Very disappointed!!!,3
Every order has come to me consistently well-made and on time. My only suggestion is to make sure the women's tees are the same each time - this time my Weezer shirt was on a v-neck that was not a woman'f fit (with a cap sleeve) but I still love it and won't send it back. Thank you.,0
Product was exactly what was advertised. Size was true. The only complaint was shipping and tracking.slow once it was shipped and very little updates on the tracking side.,6

"I love how easy it is to do everything, but I do have one or two issues. One, my creations are not showing up in searches yet. I know this will take time as I build my portfolio but it would be nice to get things moving. Two, when I search my user name I get a different user with the same name and no uploads. I believe this is an old account I may have opened up but I can't find any of the info to get rid of it. I hope the old account won't continue to supercede my own new account that I am active on. Thank you for your time.",0

"I ordered a Crossfire shirt for my wife who drives one. I ordered a Medium. The Tee came in short order and packaged fine. However the medium shirt I ordered wouldn't even fit my 11 yr old granddaughter. Worse than that, I ordered a fairly dark blue background to try and match her car. Her shirt was much darker than I anticipated with BLACK letters making her present unreadable even up close. I don't think I could be more disappointed!",3

"I am not satisfied at all with the 6 sweatshirts I ordered and will be returning them. They were all supposed to be bright orange design with white lettering on black hoodies. The white and bright orange are dull and greyish. And the actual quality of the sweatshirts themselves is poor, flimsy, and the 3XL for my son is short and he's not a tall man. I've ordered from TeePublic before and expected way better quality. I hate to have to return them but they are no where near the price I paid.So disappointed. :(",3

I would have given 5 stars except that one of the tees was dark green (very nice color) with black writing, Dark on dark was not readable, (the tee pictured made it look like it was easily read) The writing should have been in cream or light beige. I was very disappointed in it. Other than that, I was satisfied with the purchase.",3

Shirt came on time and is what I ordered but disappointed in the quality of the printing it looks blurry it's very light and thin seems like not very much ink was used and was sticky to the touch I feel like its gonna fade away after the first wash but on the other hand it was very affordable so I guess you get what you pay for,3

"Love the quality of the shirt, and of course, its sentiment!Only problem is that it's a large, but it's really BIG.Large was the smallest size I could order.A bit of a disappointment in that way.",3
Took forever to ship and the print is of really poor quality. I would not recommend.,4
"Well the delivery got delayed, which tee public stated was due to the third party carrier and needed to be resent. Not the end of the world. most of the masks I ordered look good, yet the Arnold from total recall mask was a huge disappointment. For some reason they decided to enlarge the image up to 3-4 times the average human face, so you look like a goddamn caveman or chimpanzee.",3

The products look good.Haven't worn or washed them yet to see how they feel and hold up after washing.The issue I had was the delivery time.Needed the weekend of New Year's.Ordered on 12-13-22 and it didn't ship until 12-26-22-13 days later!Was notified that it would get here by 12-30-22.Then received another notification that it wouldn't get here until 1-3-23.Didn't get notification that it was at local post office by 12-30-22.Not delivered until 1-4-23 due to weather.If I would have been notified I would have gone to post office to pick up.Disappointed on the shipping time and delivery communication.Communicated with Teepublic to have them follow up where it was at a couple of times.All I received as an answer that it was being delivered well within their shipping days allowance....they didn't take in consideration that their 3rd party company didn't ship in a timely matter in the first place...and would not do a search on it.If they would have they could have told me it was in at my local post office.Never expected it to take 22 days to receive.,3

When I wanted to send back the tshirts. Teepublic said to just donate the shirts and they would send new upsized shirts to me. Saving me money and hassles on shipping. This made everything so incredibly easy for me. Thank you! I would of course order again and recommend to others ������������,0

"I really liked the variety of options, and the ease of ordering from TeePublic. The delivery times were long, however, and we did not receive our product until the 12th business day. I understand that it was a busy time, but it was disappointing to order a product in this day of fast delivery on Dec 14th, and not receive it until Dec 31st. I was also disappointed that the graphics on one of the shirts we ordered were out of focus. Although the child was still ok with wearing the shirt (so we did not return it), for the price and the wait time, it was disappointing that it wasn't more reliable. Between my sister and myself, we ordered 4 shirts from TeePublic, and only one of them was really good quality (soft shirt, good graphic, in focus).",3
Received order in a timely manner.Happy with the merchandise.,1
It is rare today that you find such a high level of quality customer service.

"The t-shirts we ordered are good quality and look just like they appeared on the website. They arrived in a reasonable amount of time and i had updates about shipping and access to tracking information as well. I needed to exchange a couple of shirts becausethe small seemed too small, I was ordering for several family members, so I wanted to be sure everyone had the best fit. I emailed the contact form one evening and was greeted by a response next morning explaining that the new sizes were already ordered and that no return of the other shirts was necessary. I now have received the replacements and all is well. And all in time for Christmas!So easy, painless and understanding. Thanks!",0

Your website is poor and difficult to deal with in regards to returns. It is not clear and cumbersome. The biggest issue is your sizes RUN SMALL.

"As always the quality of print is top notch and the softness of the cotton is high quality. The only draw-back I have to say is that for a size men's medium, they are slightly too long. T-shirt should cover the butt so much, but it fits great on the shoulders.Thanks again for the unique designs!",0
Easy ordering and love the variety! The print is faded and is hard to see in some spots but other than that it really enjoyed the experience,1

Had a great experience with this company.The shirt i ordered was great quality but it was a woman's v neck it said to order a size up. It was still too small. A quick email to them and I fully expected to pay any price difference for switching it to a male v neck I expected a run around like I've had before from other similar companies. That was not the case woke up the next day order confirmation for the new shirt was in my inbox. Thank you Ioana for the simple process.,0

"I confess, I skeptically ordered a sweater from you not being familiar with your company and hoping it wasn't a scam. Fortunately, the product looked great and was delivered quicker than I expected. Unfortunately, it didn't fit. I needed a bigger size. Knowing you custom print, I didn't think it would be possible but in speaking with Samuel, he sent a new size out complimentary (which fit!) and allowed me to keep the other one (which I'll probably give away). No questions, no hassle. And, as someone who teaches customer service skills around the country, I must say: THAT is excellent customer service! Thank you, Samuel and TeePublic!!! I will order all future shirts/sweaters through you (and refer you to friends).",0
"The service was AMAZING!!I ordered a T-shirt but when it arrived it was a bit snug.I reached out to TeePublic to see about an exchange.Not only did they send me the next size up but told me to keep the original one too.They recommended I give it as a gift or donate it, rather than return it.This was my first time ordering from TeePublic but it certainly will not be the last.Thank you, TeePublic team!!",0

"TEE Public - Service Beyond ReproachHighly recommend this business for item choices and the service provided.I placed an order for several T-shirts and used the sizing chart to select the size I thought would be correct for me. Unbeknownst to me I had the misfortune of ordering wrong sizes. On receipt of my order the mistake was discovered. I contacted Tee Public (via online) and advised my situation. I was fully prepared to return the items for replacement shirts. Tee Public's response was that they would send replacements (in the correct size), with no requirement for me to return the first items. They suggested that I gift/donate these items to another, which I did willingly to a very thankful recipient. I would not hesitate in recommending this business to others. The selection of items/goods is infinite. I only have one complaint....Too many choices available !!. I am a fan of the Tintin character and the choices available through Tee Public were so numerous....I had a lot of trouble making a final decision.In the words of that other famous character "" I'll be back....""Thank you Tee Public.",0
I had a problem with my order. I brought to the attention of customer service and they resolved my problem right away and expressed a replacement. That's what I call great business! Thank you TeePublic! I will definitely keep you in mind.,0

My experience was nothing short of amazing! I ordered the wrong style and size originally and when I contacted you to get return information I was told to keep the shirt to donate or give to someone else!

The only reason I took 1 star away is because it took a little longer than excepted to arrive however transaction was simple and the quality is what you would except from a graphic t! Super happy with how the print looked as well!,1
My shirt turned out exactly how I hoped it would look. The large sized shirt fit correctly so it was nice to actually get it right. Large size is frequently smaller than advertised depending on which country produces the shirt. Thanks for a great product.,0
The shirt I ordered was ok in quality but nothing of the size I thought it should be. I ordered a male large and it looked more like a ladies large. Not able to give as a gift like I planned.Disappointed,3

Love the shirts and everything went smoothly!Thank you!!!,0
I have ordered a few things from Teepublic and the quality is great! I have been very happy with my purchases. Thanks!,0
Unimpressed.The print on the front was not as distinctive in colors as I expected. The quality of the material was what I expected for the cost.But the sizing was way off !!!!It looked like a child size xl shirt.Definitely not made for a grown woman.Pretty disappointed.,3
Tshirts look great and came really quick my grandson is very happy,1
Thank you for the sweater !!!My mom is going to love it; just like the picture! Great quality,0
I enjoy choosing from the large variety of t-shirts with designs if classic auto racing cars and drivers!,1
"I am always happy with TeePublic. They are true to size, good quality shirts and the graphics are always great. This is my go to for fun shirts.",1

"Shirt was mailed quickly, and fit nicely.Thank you.",0
Found what I was looking for here when I couldn't find it anywhere else!Delivery was timely and communication was great! Thank you!,0
"The quality of the material is good , but the color does not go all the way to the stitching. I ordered black you can see a thin white line over half way around the front edge of the mask, where it didn't color it all black. Not a deal breaker but with the month long shipping for a mask pretty disappointing.",3
"Many designs to choose from. I was happy to see a bunch of Elden Ring and Dark Souls designs since they were hard to find on amazon. You can get many t-shirt options like: classic, extra soft, eco tee, hoodie, tanktop, or vneck. Every once in a while they do like a 30% off sale which I didn't know about until AFTER I purchased a bunch of tshirts a couple days before hand. Very satisfying purchase tho...",1

I like the t shirts I got.. They are of good quality and very soft and comfortable.. however the placement of the designs need to be higher on the shirts and it would also be nice if you offered them with the design on the back of the shirt.. Thank you,0
Great madonna hoodie I love it! Thanks!,0
"Well, I ordered a Mumford T-shirt which is good; you can tell it's not an 'original'.But the problem was with the Rick's Cafe Americain. I ordered one and the size was a little small, but kept it, and ordered a second.The 2nd was gray (not black), didn't have the red outline of the city, and the stamping was smudged.Pretty bad quality.I have sent an email asking for an exchange and how to go about it.Thank you for asking.",0
Thank you I love the T-shirt excellent quality,0
Disappointed with the quality and thesweater is a lotsmaller than expected,3
Just received the last of the 14 Tee-shirts I ordered from you and have to save they are wonderful. These are going to be Christmas gifts. Will have to order a few more but know will get the same wonderful service. Thanks,0
Item is not what I expected. It appeared to have rhinestones adding sparkle but is only a print and the color is dull.The red doesn't pop as advertised.Very disappointed.Nothing about it says Celebration.....Would like a refund considering I was going to wear to my 50th birthday party but won't be doing that now.,3
Great imaginative print and comfortable fabric. Shipping was prompt. No issues. Thanks!,0
My niece love Robloxs and the shirt thanks,0
"You have an excellent variety.Prices are good and site is easy to use.I received the shirts well within the time it had said. The only recommendation would be some way to do measurements for the sizes (chest size, length etc.).I know you have the pictures to help but it still made it difficult to decide.Unfortunately there is no such thing as standard sizes in the clothing industry.Other than that, it was a great experience and I will most likely order from you again.Thank you and happy holidays!",0
The mug I ordered is a gift for my Daughter In Law it has her favourite band logo on it . I'm so glad it was available on your site.. Thank You,0
"My Go-To place for shirts. Anything you can think of...music, art, sports, family, comics, fav TV show or movie and you will find it at TeePublic.

Sizing chart was accurate. Shirts received in timely manner!,6
If you're ordering a large size Tshirt they run pretty small like mediums so make sure you order one size up from what you usually wear. Decent selection and delivery time. Thanks.,0
"I absolutely love my bag! Shipping took no time, and the quality is amazing. Thank you!",0
Easy and smooth transaction. Picked the fast shipping and it was here within a week. High quality detail. Thank you,0
I enjoy the variety of choices you have. I���������ve ordered 2 shirts so far and they are of good quality. The fun thing is that it���������s never the same one on a different page as you scroll through the site. Always something new to look forward to on the next purchase.Both of my shirts have a Star Wars theme. I also enjoy the shirts that take a look back in time as if they were made in the late 70��������,1
"Everything was well packaged, but not all items were up to par to give as gifts. I was disappointed.",3
"Really good products and well worth the 3 week shipping wait to Melbourne . A real genuine team who provide more than helpful support and feedback. They even threw in a free exchange because I had ordered a size too small for my first time. Well, it was a free shipment of the new size without having me to return the old one. Instead I was told to keep it or donate it to a friend. Really feel like a treasured customer. Thank you Teepublic !",0
"Loved everything as always! High quality products, great customer service, and quick shipping! Thank you so much! I'll be ordering again! Wishing you Hsppy Holidays and A Blessed Merry Christmas!",0
The order was correct and got to me in time for Xmas! Thank you!,0
I merchandise was high quality and the sizes are very accurate,6
"Everything came on time! YAY!All the shirts are what I had asked for, however for me, premium shirts should be 100% cotton and perhaps just a little bit thicker fabric. I hope you will have this choice for next time I order. Thank you for helping to make my packages arrive in time for Christmas!!You are awesome!MJH",0
"The quality of the products I've received from this company has dropped significantly in just 2 years. In 2016, I placed an order of over a dozen shirts and they were all soft, well-fitting, and the printing was clean & natural. Today I just received a large order but man was I disappointed; the shirts were not soft (more coarse), the fit was boxy, and the print was faded and looks like it was just slapped on there. I actually ordered the same shirt design/color/size from 2 years ago and the difference is night and day between the two. It's obvious a different base shirt is being used across the board. Very disappointed will not be returning in the future.",3
"Great shirts, fast shipping.Very happy with my purchase!",1
"The printing was very good but the actual shirt quality was not as good as expected.. ordered a 2xl which should have been more than comfortable runs small,as my normal size is xl, I always go up a size on cotton t shirts.. the stitching in the hem came undone after one wash even on delicate. A bit disappointed and I���������m not sure if I will be ordering in t",3
"I ordered a ladies tee shirt over a week ago.I am not the largest woman, but I ordered a 3X b/c I wanted to make sure it would be roomy.When it arrived, I tried it on and the size was not accurate...it was actually about 2 sizes smaller than indicated.When I went to your website, it stated that the shirt could not be returned.I am very disappointed, and I will be sure to relate my feelings to other prospective buyers.",3

Thank you for a cool item and fast delivery can't wait to get the others I ordered.,0
"The shovel head t-shirt large I ordered seems small for a large. I need to tell person not to put it in dryer or it will never fit, 100% cotton always shrinks. Might tell customers to buy 1 size larger! The cup I ordered is great, might have option to have logo on both sides, thanks, Joe V.",0

"There are two elements to service for an online order - the ordering process (i.e. the website) and the delivery.The ordering process was great - really good website.However, I placed my order on 3rd July using international delivery which is supposed to be 10-15 days. The items actually arrived on 27th July. For all I know this may be the fault of UPS (their online tracking certainly suggests that the package just sat in the same place for days on end). Either way, it was a very disappointing service and undermined the products as they were ordered as a birthday gift. UPDATE to original review: TeePublic contacted me immediately after I posted this review, apologised for the delay (even though it might have been UPS's fault), and refunded the cost of delivery. Excellent customer service that should be recognised and applauded.",3

the hoodie itself was nice and soft but the design on it wasnt what it looked like online. it was smaller than the large print on the website. you can barely see it. i ordered a navy hoodie with a biggie print but the print was waaaaaayyyyy too small and so hard to see. it was disappointing especially for the price. i expected the print to be bigger and brighter yet it was small and dark.,3

"I didn't realize TeePublic has a satisfaction guarantee for size exchanges, but it is so wonderful to know since I don't have to worry about whether an item will fit. I had bought a hoodie for my husband, who wears a medium size shirt and jacket, but when I got it in, it seemed a bit small. It was my mistake for not going a size up for a hoodie I suppose, but TeePublic was so generous to get me a large hoodie. I will definitely be shopping on TeePublic in the future for that reason alone. Thank you guys, and God bless!",0
Original tee was too small so I was told not to return & they would send a bigger size. This all took place within 10 days. Customer service is awesome! Thank you.,0

Our P51 shirt had a thumb print size mark in the pattern. Still wearable but I was disappointed. Hi the other shot s were great,3
The SHERLOCK TEE with a violin prominently displayed is exactly what I wanted. Thank you to the artist for such a beautiful design. It's subtle and not IN YOUR FACE like many other Sherlock Holmes shirts I've seen.,0
"Not completely happy. I ordered 2 items.Same design, one on a magnet, one on a button.The magnet was adorable.The button was off center.I contacted TeePublic and they said there was nothing they could do.That's how it's designed.I disagree, it looks like quality control slipped up.Regardless, the item is a piece of paper in a plastic button.There is no reason they can't center the design within the button but instead they chose to have an unhappy customer that will not order again or wear the button.",4
"Great shirt! I was worried what I would end up getting once I ordered, fearing it would be made cheaply with poor images...but once I opened the package I was thrilled beyond belief!Thank you! ����������������",0

"The print in one shirt seemed a bit fuzzy and on both shirts where there is a lot of white it still feels sticky and seems like it would peel easily when washed and I don���������t put them in the dryer. Obviously I haven���������t washed or worn these and the one shirt that was supposed to be a large and says large on tag, measured the same as the medium. I was very dissatisfied and disappointed. To solve this problem ",3
Shirts got lost in the mail and customer service provided excellent service sending replacements. Thanks again!,0
"The fabric of my tee is so thin, you can literally see through it. Extremely disappointed.",3
Graphics were awesome on the 2 T-shirts I purchased for Hubby. However the quality of T-shirts material was terrible. Thin like a well worn shirt. Neckline was slouchy as well as the look of shirt. I was very disappointed in the material of T-shirt was poor quality. This Birthday gift was disappointing.,3

The humpty had a great fall hoodie I ordered was a gift for my mom. And for $60 it looked like like the bright and vivid picture on the website. The orange yellow and black looked all faded. And almost double printed. Very disappointing.,3
I am very happy with everything that I have purchased.,1
My little great grandson love the shirt we got from you thanks,0

"Love the shirts I got, perfect thank you!",0
"Great shirt! Shipped timely, thank you.",0
The shirt I ordered was unsatisfactory.The print was very dull and faint which is NOT what the ad showed.I expected a vibrant print and am VERY disappointed in what I received,3
I really like the T-shirts. After an initial email to let me know my order was on its way I didn't get any further emails and wasn't sure how to track it so started to think I was never going to receive my order. And I read poor reviews on the web that said this company could be a scam. But got my order yesterday and happy with the quality. Especially like the pink V neck T-shirt with the staffy pic on it. So thank you!,0
The size I originally ordered was too short and when I asked if they had a tall or another size they replaced for no charge. This makes ordering a tshirt online without trying it on so much less stressful. Thanks TeePublic!,0
I had a problem with a product and was given a response and refund within hours.Very good service.Thank you.,0
"I ordered a T-shirt and face masks. I was very pleased with all products received.My order came in two shipments so when I enquired via email as to when to expect the second shipment, I received a response within 24 hours and the response was courteous and accurate.She said I would receive the parcel by December 9th, and I did.So happy with the quality of the products and the quality of the service.",1
It's a prefect fit and i love it thank you so much,0
I love it. Thanks.,0

Product was awesome. My Dad loved his predator tshirt. It took a couple days longer than I planned but the look on his face was worth it. Thank you so much.,0
"Liked the worn off look on the text. Didn't like the worn look on the image of MJ itself.Either way, still works for me. Thanks!",0
"The shirt came out nice, the order was printed prepared and shipped fast I was. Did happy",1
The quality of printing and shirt fabric was poor.Disappointed in the result for the price.,3

Fast delivery and tee shirts were great.Ordered 12 for Halloween!Thank you,0
So so happy with my order!! Everything came out great!!,1
"Very disappointed that I paid extra for the so called ""heavy weight"" t-shirt. Th material is very thin. I have yet to receive the order I placed 2 days before the one I got. One was shipped by FedEx and the other one by the USPS, and was supposed to be a Christmas present and here it is December 29th and I still don't have it. I should have only given a two star rating. Very dissatisfied all the way around",3
"I can't say enough about TeePublic. When couple of my shirts needed exchanging for a bigger size they didn't hesitate to send me new ones for free. I was told to keep the ones that don't fit (unfortunately it's such a personal shirt I can't find anyone to give it to, maybe I'll become really thin someday lol). Anyway the new ones fit perfectly I am so pleased with them and have been wearing them around. Now that I know my exact size will definitely order more from them. Thanks so much for your wonderful customer service. It's becoming really rare these days. Will definitely recommend this site to others. Keep up the good work! Thanks!",0
"Hello, I love my new shirt. However, this Large shirt seemed more like a medium. So I gave it to my sister. She really loves it. Thank you for fulfilling her Christmas wish.",0

"Brilliant hoodie and prompt service, thank you!",0
I ordered two shirts for my Wife and I for Our new Indian Bike. We were informed of the wait time and are very happy with the product. The Colors were spot on and sizes too.,1
"Great fit and my 7 yr old loves it! I took a star off (but really it should only be 1/2 a star off) because the graphics got dark in hue where the details were smaller, so the characters were not as clear. However, for as many characters as they fit into this print, they were still pretty good and awesome enough for my kid to be completely psyched about it. Thank you!",0
This company has one of the best customer service departments I have had the pleasure of dealing with. They are efficient and extremely punctual with their responses to my questions and concerns. They are very customer oriented and seem to just want to please. Thank you for all your help this holiday season!,0

"Blur T-shirtHi-I just received my t-shirt.The graphics are wonderful, but the quality of the shirt is extremely thin.That is why I upgraded to a more expensive shirt, but the quality of this shirt leads me to believe I received the basic t-shirt without the upgrade.Just wanted to let you know in case it was a mistake on your end.Thanks so much.Kathy",0
Happy with the product. Sizes run a bit small.,1
I love you I will always come to you thanks for taking care of me,0

"I was highly disappointed with the quality of the 3 shirts I purchased. The images appear extremely washed out in color. They also appear fuzzy around the edges of the logos. They look as if they've been owned, worn and washed for several years despite being brand new. I would not purchase here again. Sizing was as expected and delivery was on time.",3
All of the shirts are super soft and look fantastic. My husband will love them.Thank you!!!,0

The tee shirt was to have Mafia across the front but it���������s just a picture of a Buffalo. Disappointed,3
I like the fit of the shirts. This is my second order and I am disappointed to see the same color ink printed on a shirt so it is invisible.I would not have ordered blue and purple if the advertisement showed it illegible. My daughter came in last night with her new shirt on. It made me kinda queasy.,3
"TeePublic offered me exactly what I was looking for. I looked all over for the right In This Moment hoodie. I didn't find it until I looked on TeePublic. Not only did they have the print I was looking for, but they had different options on the type of hoodie I could choose from. My choice was the premium hoodie. I was very pleased once I received it. It fit perfectly, the print was amazing, and it didn't take forever to get. I would recommend TeePublic to anyone looking for amazing quality and great service. Thank you so much for my perfect hoodie!",0

Updated. See below for original review. I am still giving the original overall product a 3 star due two having issues with both the original and replacement. However customer service is top notch.

Super happy with shirt and quick delivery for Christmas,1
"I ordered something for christmas on November 25 and paid $7 for standards shipping (7-10 days). Fast forward to December 23 (essentially a full month later and a day before christmas) and the quality is subpar, the text is fuzzy, and the coloring is absolutely off.

You guys are awesome. You have responded to my questions about my order promptly. Thank you,0
"This would have been five stars had the graphic been printed on the cup so a right-handed person could see it. When I pick up the mug all I see is black which is very disappointing. I guess it's my fault I ordered it since it is as pictured. Other than that, the Thurman Munson graphic is great, the mug came quickly and was well packed.I would recommend that the artist put the graphic on both sides of the mug or on the side where someone picking it up with their right hand would see it.",3
Good quality very happy,1
"I'm so disappointed with my order.I received notification that my order was delivered, but I did not receive it.I tried to figure out how to contact your customer service so I could order another exact order for the gift I had planned to give this week and then determine where the original package later.

"Very impressed: I ordered a product expected to arrive by Christmas Day and received tracking information until Dec 13. I contacted customer service Dec 30 and had a response within hours. TeePublic offered to reship the product, I agreed. They contacted me again because the product was not in stock, offered me an alternative produce and to refund the difference in payment; I agreed and received confirmation that the alternative product was being processed. All this happened Dec 30 - during the holiday period. However, the original product arrived Dec31and I immediately contacted TeePublic and was able to stop the reshipment. TeePublic customer service was extraordinarily responsive and offered to rectify the situation without question. I would highly recommend them to others and will purchase from TeePublic again.",6

"Customer Service was the best ever, truly. What bugged me was that the sizes were simply incorrect. I got what I ordered according to the label, but I could barely get them on. And believe me I'm not significantly overweight. I'm not sure I could've gotten into them when I was a skinny 18! Very disappointing because the quality of the shirt itself was excellent.",3

I bought shirts for myself & family members. We absolutely loved all of them & can't wait to buy more!!! Thank you������,0
"It took a long time to receive the shirt, and when it finally came I was really disappointed. The image was very low quality, quite pixelated. It had obviously been enlarged from a low resolution image. Also, it was very different than on the website preview before I bought it - the colors were affected by the T-shirt color. Ideally, a screen of white should have been applied below the image so it showed the intended colors of the image. On the light blue T-shirt I ordered, the yellow of the image became greenish. I would return this if I could but since they are ""made to order"" I'm out $20. 1/10 would not recommend.",3
My nephew absolutely loved the shirts that were made for him. He put them on as soon as I receive them. Great quality and very well-made. Thank you so much!,0

Product was just like described. I had been looking for a new Undertaker T-shirt. Could not have found a Cooler design for such a Great Price! Thank You!!!,0
"The phone cases are really nice and fit properly to our new phones. We ordered the phone cases hoping to find the texture to be slip resistant as the phone without the case is super slippery.We chose the ""protective"" option thinking that it would help, but, unless we missed it, the description of the case doesn't elaborate on the texture. The case does make the phone less slippery, but it's not that rubberized slip resistant feeling. The artwork is centered and looks great. If you're looking for a nice case, but are not concerned withslippage, then this is the case for you.The actual ordering process was concise and delivery was timely.TeePublic will be a site I visit again when looking for something unique to support the talented folks that sell their products.Thank you!",0
"I bought two shirts my son selected for his back-to-school wardrobe. The low-cost was great for my budget and my son liked the selection of designs. They arrived on time but the absolute best was the fabric. Soft and comfortable! And the fit was perfect! Consequently, we will be ordering more next month. Thank you, TeePublic!",0

Almost 40 dollars for a thin tshirt that took weeks to arrive.Have yet to get the stickers I ordered.I do not recommend this site nor will I purchase from it again.,4
"You offer an AMAZING selection, and your sizing presentation is THE BEST I've ever seen (and I have many dozens of political shirts from many sources. It's also great to have so many shirt types to choose from.) Regrettably, some of my ""negative"" may not be your responsibility, but the fact that 5 of the 6 shirts I ordered are simply iron-on decals certainly is. The need to take care when washing, and then line dry those five to make them have more than a very brief lifetime seems unfortunate for the price (even on ""eternal"" sale.)Raw Story advertises you as a supplier of ""fun liberal"" shirts, and as such it's more than a little disconcerting to see so much far-right and pro-Drumpf material. I've brought that to Raw Story's attention, and I can only hope it will be a greater concern for you than it is for them (after paying $95 for an annual subscription.) I suspect I'm not the only person to cancel an order due to these items (though, admittedly, I didn't realize the magnitude until after my first order. That second order in my cart will not be completed.)Thank you for asking, and I wish you the best. (You do have some very special designs.)",0
I absolutely love the breathable material. I also appreciated the fact the the stretching of the material did not deface the writing. I will be ordering again soon. Thank you for taking pride in the work you do.One pleased customer....,0

They handled my size issue very well and my friend received the shirt that didn't fit and I received the correct sized shirt. Very generous of them to not want me to return the shirt that didn't fit. They were very quick with their responses and actions to resolve the issue. Thanks again,0

"Love the design, good quality shirt ,will definitely order again.thanks alot",0
The shirt was of poor quality. Very disappointed,3
They order was super delayed and all they wanted to do was give me a 30% discount on next purchase. I had to argue that I can get that discount with any coupon code online. Only then they gave me back my shipping cost. Still really disappointing considering they charge same amount as Redbubble but their items arrive faster,3
"First, the good stuff... Your product arrived in a timely fashion and I think your pricing is fair. Had it been for these two points, I would've left a 5-star rating. Unfortunately the product itself fell short. The printing is faded in some spots, there were no vibrant colors at all in the print (even though this is obviously a new shirt, the quality makes you think it's old and has been washed a multitude of times).I can almost see that after one washing, these issues would be even worse. I was happy with your service but very disappointed by the product itself. This was going to be a gift for someone who really enjoys this Netflix show but now I have to find an alternative.",3

"I���������m pretty disappointed with the print quality and overall shirt quality. For $20 I���������d expect a fairly decent shirt, the ink and printing process look cheap, almost like it was home made. The lines are soft with bleed and the colors are faded. Also I purchased one male and one female shirt in royal blue and they are two completely different shades. I���������ve purchased plenty of tee���������s from online shops that support indie designers but this quality ",3
Item was exactly what I ordered. Thank you.,0
"I found the perfect t-shirt for my son who was turning 13 during the quarantine - especially since it was a black tee (he likes wearing black) and a nice design. The website noted that there were some delays with getting orders, but I thought I left enough time for having the shirt done and shipped to me by his birthday - 3 weeks - and the estimated delivery was about 0n his birthday. Unfortunately, there were delays and I received the shirt five days after his birthday. Therefore, he couldn't wear his unique shirt at his birthday drive-by/social distance gathering which was disappointing. However, he does have a neat shirt to wear the rest of the year. I would order again to support this company, but keep in mind the logistics and order even earlier.",3

"The prints are beautiful. BUT. The shirts, not so much. I ordered one print Men's XL and one print Women's Large. The women's large is BIGGER than the men's XL. How is that possible?And the woman's shirt is polyester and viscose, so no shrinking. I bend over? you see everything. The men's is 23 inches armpit to armpit. The woman's is 24 inches. It's unwearable and it will be donated. I understand these are from the artist, so there is no refund, but it is so disappointing. Not sure how to trust this site to order a new shirt for a woman.",3

"I seldom witness a company that corrects my mistake of choosing the wrong size by replacing a different size for free.I chose a Ladies M and it was too tight; so analyzing the size chart again, I chose a men's premium S which will not be so clingy.I was willing to send the 1st one back but Teepublic declined and is sending me the 2nd request free.What a nice gesture.Thank you Teepublic.I will visit you again.",0

I am extremely disappointed I purchased two shirts one for my son size 3x and one for my daughter XL both were ridiculously untrue to size The XL women's was so small it barely fit my 9 year old grandson who is in a boys largeand the 3x actually looked shorter than the woman's XL.These were supposed to be a Christmas present for both (That's not happening ),3
The graphics are great. I'm disappointed in the quality of one of the shirts. One is Hanes (blue) with is a heaver material and the other one (grey) is Gildan which I've never heard of and is a much thinner material.,3
Thanks a lot. Great fit. Awesome product,0

I purchased a T-shirt and sized up just in case but it turned out that I needed the original size instead. I reached out to customer service and they were AMAZING!! The online exchange process was very easy to navigate. Customer service got in touch by day two which was understandable and very prompt in my opinion. They were quick to send out my exchange and let me keep the original. How awesome is that?!?! All in all the company went above and beyond my expectations and I am very pleased to have found this online store and I shall be making more purchases in the future. Thank you Teepublic!,0

"Our masks are soft and good quality. They were initially a bit big, but very easy to alter with a couple of stitches. They took a few weeks to get here, probably due to COVID delays with the post. Look like they'll be fine in the washing machine. All in all very happy with purchase. Thank you.",0

"I took this image and request to a local shop and they told me I would have to agree to a dozen copies at 12.99 each. I took that offer home and did more research online and found you. With you I could choose how many copies I wanted, plus a little shipping and a little tax (because I live in CA), came out to about $40. Compare that to the local shops offer. NO BRAINER!!! Thanks so much.By the way, I don't plan to start wearing the shirts until I go see a theater showing of the next X-Men movie, Dark Phoenix, in June. But besides that, thanks so much.",0

"Great selection of cool and funny shirts.Prices are reasonable, however, I was a little disappointed with the quality of the print on the shirt.It looks like its going to come off after one wash and doesn't look high quality (not as clear picture).",3
It is but I'm going to see if I can wash it and make it stretcha nice shirt I mean it's very nice but it is a little tight in the sleeve caps so I think it's just how you make your shirts they're smaller than what they look like but other than that it's nice thank you for making it but I'm in it see if I can wash it and make it stretch a little bigger so I don't have to go through all exchanging stuff,0
Service and everything was fine.. I was just disappointed with the quality of the printing.,3

"ordering process, updates, shirt quality and shipping process were all excellent. Thanks",0
Not impressed that I searched for something specific and was brought to a product that had a grammar error in it. My fault for missing it but I searched a specific phrase so I thought that���������s what I was getting. $18 for a grammar mistake on a 4��������� magnet��������� disappointed that I didn���������t catch the error until I was wrapping it. Hopefully it���������ll at least get ,3

The Miami Dolphin t-shirts I bought for my best friend's little 5-year old boys were BIG hit. They had grown out of the previous ones & I waited a little too long to order new ones. I was very pleased with the colors & the official logo.Thanks to the artist who designed them!!!,0
The shirt was too small. I normally wear an XL but decided to go a little larger by getting a 2XL.Very disappointed as I will not be able to wear it to our family Christmas Dinner. I know it would have been a hit.,3

The graphics weren't that readable on the actual mask like they were on the online photos.The creases were sewn such in a way that parts of the letters were hidden. Was disappointed in how they came out.I did appreciate that they arrived quickly but because I paid for fast shipping,3

"The customer service was dressed to the nines, metaphorically speaking, Usually after you order something and the buisness ships it off the company lets whatever happen just happen, but when I accidentally put no apartment details, I got it changed and it was there the very next day.

Easy and enjoyable process.Quick turn around!!!Terrific quality.,1
The shirts are different shades of black. The design is not as pictured and is faded. Very disappointing considering the cost. Seems almost like a cheap screen print.,3
"The product was fine, but the service was not. DHL informed me, when I contacted them to find out where my parcel was, that it was being held by Royal Mail as there was an unpaid customs fee to pay. As I don't drive and the office isn't near public transport, I had to get a cab to the collection office, and home again, which cost me ������10, and then had to pay ������12.70 customs fee on my parcel. So not only did I have the inconvenience of having to go and collect the parcel, I had to pay a total of ������22.70 extra ($28.71 approx).If you are going to offer delivery outside of the USA, then all delivery costs, including customs fees, should be included in the delivery costs. This is not the first company in the USA I have ordered from, but it is the first time I have ever had to pay an unpaid customs fee.I'm very disappointed and won",3

"SUPER GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!! First time ordering with this company, ordered three shirts on the large side and a coffee mug. The three shirts were definitely a little too big so I asked them to exchange them for the next size down, all three of them. Teepublic said sure no problem, please take the three shirts that are too large and donate them. I informed TeePublic that we donate on a regular basis to a veterans group. They said wonderful, thank you for doing that. All I can say is in the next few days I will be ordering at least four more shirts from them. Robert.",0
I bought both a t-shirt and mug. I love the design on the items. It is very well done and clever and exactly what I hoped for. I bought them as gifts and the recipients were thrilled.Thank you TeePublic and MilkofParadise!,0

"The shirts I got are pretty nice however my account was shut down within 12 hours with no explanation why.I emailed 3 times asking and never got a response.I hadn���������t had time to set up my payment info so essentially you all sold my designs to me, shut me down, won���������t pay me my commission, and refuse to even contact me back.The biggest bummer is they turned out so nice I would have loved t",3

All tee was in soft hand feel fabric. Graphic print wise...It's fantastic! Some parts of the printing toning does not stay out, especially on the black tee shirt (stormtrooper deadpool print) the high light white and the darker tone red not obvious. The rest of the print area are just perfect! You guys are AWESOME! Thank you so much for doing such a hard work and the best as you can! Love you all!",0

The printing on the masks was very good but the actual size and shape was inefficient and not particularly suitable as a viable mask. It did not properly cover the mouth and nose of my 5 year old daughter. Overall disappointed with the fit of this mask.,3
Showed right up like usual. Funny tee shirt for Apres. Thank you!,0
Happy with my purchase everything I expected,1

"Shipping is fast and the quality of shirts are great. The only issue I have is the design on the last shirt I got is almost invisible. It's fine for what I got it for but I'm disappointed. If a shirt color is too dark for the printing, it shouldn't be offered.",3
Loved the LSU magnets!! Great quality! Thank you!!,0
I like what I received.My mugs are perfect and were shipped in the safest way possible.Thank you !,0
Never got items originally ordered.Finally shipped new ones to another address then had to request another size since first too small.Could only communicate via email.Quality of merchandise is fair.Would probably never order again.This is why I do very little online shopping.Thank you.Everyone was professional and cooperative.,0
It was great to find a t-shirt with all of the main characters of the Sanford & Son TV series. The shirt looks and feels incredible. Thank you so much for all of the designs I have been able to purchase through your site. Keep up the great work!,0
As always excellent merchandise and great professional website thank you,0
"I was looking for Argentina jerseys or tshirts about Messi. Most of them sold out, and did not really feel like using the adidas one, for some reason no size fit well after trying them in store. I ran into teepublic, first time there. Wrote ""Messi"", and to no one's surprise, a wide range of options came in front of my eyes. I picked one (to save money, cause I loved more than a few) and bought it in two different sizes just to be sure. They arrived a few days later. Nice quality, probably the image not fully as I expected. Still nice, don't get me wrong, just something unlike what I had in mind... maybe more artistic than photographic, to put it into words. But well done again, and good quality. As mentioned, one of the sizes worked, the other one was to have a back up, as I was a bit between sizes. I contacted them to share this, and they offered to send me a third tshirt for free of the size that worked, which was the cherry on top. Nice customer service, quality and overall experience at amore than reasonable priceconsidering all options and the overall process. I will definitely be visiting them and buying something else in the future. Congrats and thanks for your help.",0
"Very high quality hoodie, really comfortable and soft. Enjoyed it a lot.",1

"5 custom tee-shirts were excellent; quality was as good as I have seen anywhere on a tee-shirt; custom art was just just what I needed; colors were bright; price was Ok, after discount; delivery time was faster than promised; fit was perfect on the one long sleeveshirt I have tried on so far. Tomorrow I try on the next one.Also the company (which I knew nothing about) kept me informed along the way regarding each step of the process.Thanks,MWO, California",0
"Overall disappointed.The quality of the shirts is goo. However, the sizes are very inconsistent.I followed the recommendation of buying the next size up in women's shirts. One fits well, the other is skin tight. The printing on most of the shirts (7 in total) is thin and already cracking when they were delivered.",3
It was fast.Thank you,0
"The T was to small, I reordered the T and received it in a few days at no charge.No problem with the service.Thanks",0
Shirts fit as expected but the printing is not as good as I expected....Seems like minimal amount of ink used in screening process,3
I received a couple of T shirts and the shirt are not even pregnant correctly.The color is not dark enough and on 2 of the shirts the drawing is not even centered. I was very excited for my order but when I received it I was super disappointed.,3
Mask broke even before I put it on. Would not recommend.,4
Thank you I can't wait to receive my T-shirtGreat service,0
"Ok the designs are really cool but the sizing is just atrocious. I guess they're making these clothes for extremely fat people. My wife if 5'3"" 135lbs, 32DD-25-37 and guess what? Their smallest size tee looks HUGE on her, this is supposedly the womens v-neck where they even recommend ordering two sizes up because they fit 'tight'. They clearly do not fit tight, not even remotely close to tight infact. I'm very disappointed. They have so many options yet not a single one is slim fit or tight.",3
I found exactly what I was looking for and was kept up to date about receiving my order and shipping. I am very happy I found this site.,1

I ordered my Biggie Smalls T-shirt in a xxxl.When I received my order yesterday, and opened it my biggie smalls shirt was a three XL but it was the worst quality shirt I have ever received from this company very disappointed.It was not the same T-shirt brand that my golden girls shirt came in in a three XL. The quality is worse than you get at Walmart. I would like the shirt reprinted and reset to me on a better quality T-shirt woman�������",3
Really happy with the buttons I received. I ordered a large amount and I was happy they shipped and arrived quickly and looked awesome,1
"I ordered several different Disney designs, and all 5 are fantastic!Exactly as pictured!Extremely lovely quality of the print and the shirts!Thank you!",0
Tshirt material was very thin and the cut is small but the length is long. Very disappointed!!,3
We enjoyed looking through all the unique tee shirts. It was fun seeing different designs then the same thing on many other websites. The t-shirts are gray quality and the designs are exactly what we saw online. They shipped promptly and the prices were so affordable! All around a great experience.,1
Fast service! Thank you!,0
The print is very dull. Disappointed!,3
"Excellent shirts, thanks",0
"The delivery was in time and I love my new shirt.Perfect size, colour and message on it.Thank you very much.Best RegardsMarcus",0
"This isnt my first time ordering off of teepublic. But, this time, the colors on my sirt were very disappointing. The yellow was not even really yellow... The colors were very faded compared to the original picture.",3
"I don't even know where to begin with my dissatisfaction with this company and my order! I placed 3 separate orders the first 5/10, the second 5/25, and third 5/26. I received the second and third orders within 14 days. So I emailed customer service because my first order still did not have tracking. As stated on their web site I expected a 48 hour wait for a return email, 5 full business days later I finally got a reply that said shipping was 10-20 days. Incredibly unhelpful. Tracking finally posted to my order 5/31, but did not leave the facility until 6/5. The original tracking had my order arriving 6/9 and still did not arrive until 6/11. I sent another email when my order arrived because the masks look nothing like what I ordered and expected and it took over 30 days to complete even though newer orders had arrived much more quickly and they were correct. Another 5 days later Teepublic's idea of ""making it right"" was refunding my shipping. So disappointed in the whole process and feel absolutely foolish for ordering with this company in a time when how you spend your money and protect your family is critical.",3
"The images on the shirts are great, however, the sizes are not accurate���������the extra large shirt was smaller than the medium���������one size small shirt is smaller than the other size small shirt..I bought 4 shirts and on,y one is able to be worn ..very disappointed���������",3

It took quite sometime for my order to finally arrived but I understand that mistakes do happen. I'm happy that it's exactly what I ordered and nothing more,1
"I was very excited to place my order for an SSR shirt from Captain America the First Avenger.As a cosplayer, this was a fairly simple piece which I could pair up with a generic pair of khaki slacks to do another stage in Cap's evolution.The shirt was inexpensive, the shipping was fast.However, when I received the product I was disappointed.While the quality of the material of the garment was fine, the image was not screen printed correctly on the garment.It was askew by as much as 15-20 degrees, a noticeable alignment error.This was very disappointing and it looks like I'm going to have to look for another shirt via another vendor.While I fully intend to keep the shirt as it will make for a fine undershirt to wear under my heavier cosplays, I do not intend to order from the same artist as there seems to be a complete lack of Quality Control in effect.",3
"My shirts came quickly, looked exactly as they did online and are of great quality. Thanks!",0

"This is my second t-shirt purchase from your site and it did not disappoint! Quality material and printing of what I wanted, great prices, shipping made it a bit spendy but that's because I only bought one I think. Had I bought more that may have helped it not seem so much.

Very disappointed - Ordered shirts late November 2021 and paid an extra shipping fee (in addition to the cost of the shirts) for GURANTEED delivery before Christmas. Shirts arrived 10th January 2022. On Christmas day I was short of gifts (i.e. these shirts) as I believed ''guaranteed delivery before Christmas'' meant exactly that! Suffice to say I will never buy from them again and even a full refund cant fix the bad experience/memory of being short of gifts on Christmas day.,3

"It was so great to have a company truly concerned about a costumers experience. In reordering I wish I had known that the ladies classic tee runs 2 sizes smaller. I did use the size chart, so hope this works out. The helpful hint from Newbert about ordering from the relaxed fit would have been helpful to know before I ordered. Hopefully the new tee works out. I have been looking at some of your other tees. You have some fun offers. Thank you.",0

"In my opinion there is hype about the service and you fall short.The updates are poor, no real detail.The shirt was""printing"" for 4 days.The shipping must have been the slowest possible option, according to your updates it sat for days in Arizona and then more days in California.The package was delivered on December 30. The order was placed on December 16.All in all, I think the experience was bad, the quality of the fabric poor and the image on the shirt was distorted.I am disappointed in the entire process from start to finish.",3

Nathalie at TeePublic understood my question on my exchange. Advised me on how to correct it. Very helpful indeed.Thank you,0
TeePublic is a very great website that helps independent artists get their products sold. It helped me come up with unique Christmas presents this year! Shipping was quick and the product was in great condition. Only downside to my purchase would be that the size medium was pretty big and larger than I expected it to be. Nothing too serious though. I really enjoy my experience using this company.,1

"I ordered a women's FJ Cruiser t-shirt for my wife. The shirt arrived quickly but it was way too small, more like a child size. I contacted TeePublic and requested a replacement. A day later they said they were making a new one in a larger size and that we didn't need to send the old shirt back so we donated it. The second shirt arrived very quickly also and is perfect. I thank you for making this fast and uncomplicated. Great customer service, we will be ordering again.",0

"Thank you Tee Public! You always aim to please, and it's much appreciated! However I will admit one of the tees I ordered arrived looking a bit different than the picture. It's a shark coming out of a pocket, and for some reason, you can barely see the pocket, so it just looks like a half a shark on the shirt. It still looks cool, but not what I thought.

Nice prints by your company. Great artist throughout the site. Keep up the great work. Thank you...,0
Website was easy to navigate and I was able to find exactly what I wanted. Shipping process was quick; especially for it to be a busy season with the holidays. And I really like that the print was in the shirt not just a piece of vinyl that would probably start peeling after a few washes. Very happy!,1
The tee that I received is great. It fits really well and the quality is well made. I will be buying more tees from TeePublic.Thanks!,0
Put in my order and the explanation of the process was awesome. I have worked in printing in the past and the craftsmanship and production and shipping was second to none.Thank you for a professionally produced product.Sincerely John McDermott,0

I have purchased many shirts and totes from TeePublic and they have all been excellent.Printing is sharp and just as advertised and the materials used high quality. Thank you!,0
"I am 5 ft tall and weigh 120 so wear a petite 6.I ordered a women's medium as I like my tees comfy and loose.This shirt is so small, I doubled check the size thinking you must have sent a child's size. Nope!Cannot wear it and will either find a young little girl or donate.Wasted 6+ weeks for this shirt. Very disappointed.",3
"I buy a lot of tee shirts (I have over 50) and am known for my tee shirts at work and in my social circle. I've used all kinds of online sites, from 6 Dollar Shirts (not bad for the price!) to Redbubble (great quality printing). I had high hopes for TeePublic, but I'm disappointed as the printing on this shirt is pixilated (jagged squares) on the edges and blobby with colors overlapping in the middle. The picture on the site looked sharp. The actual shirt is average quality (fabric a little thin and neck ring a little narrow) compared to a premium tee like Vans or Champion. I'd send it back, but I'm way too lazy.",3

"Poor quality, color not asin the pictures. Not recommended.",4

Great quality and arrived before it was scheduled. Thank you so much!,0
It was very obvious the t-shirt I received was not printed well. The design is barely visible. I would think for a specialty t-shirt costing $30 that a little more skill would have gone into printing the design. This was a disappointing gift to have to give to someone.,3
Thank you! Your customer service was outstanding!,0
"Great quality, compatible sizing, fast and efficient service Will definitely use again and recommend to friends Thank you",0
Products shipped quickly and as advertised. Very happy with the look and feel of my shirts.,1

I needed the shirts for the next weekend, so 5 business days was perfect, as the shirts should arrive on that Friday at the latest. However, the shirts didn���������t arrive until the following Monday, which was extremely disappointing as I ordered them for a family vacation and was obviously unable to use them. When they arrived, two shirts which were the exact same color and design had different color designs and two shirts that were supposed to be the exact same color were not.

Lots of T-shirts to choose from. My husband is an 80���������s guru so this site it the place to go! Thank you for great selections! So much more than 80���������s too. I even bough,0
I normally am a standard Small in size. I weigh 114-115. I read a review to go up one size I did. Medium was still tight. Tee Public said they will send a large. I got the large today fits perfect. To avoid the mistake of sizing go up 2 sizes or even 3. Hope Tee Public will fix their sizing. I want to get my husband a Tesla tee too but not sure again how men���������s sizing is. He is a medium in standard size so let me know how many sizes to go up. But I thank the company for making this issue right. More power,0
"The ""GO MOD"" on the T shirt was far more faded than the photos presented...a little lame....disappointing.",3
"I received the wrong color shirt. I was politely advised I could not exchange the item unless it was damaged (as is clearly stated online). But I was also offered a discount, if I wanted to order again, in a different color. After more carefully re-reading the website, and not having the budget for another order, I would just have to accept what I got.However, within less than 24 hours, I received no fewer than 3 TeePublix texts, assuring me I would be sent another shirt, in my preferred color, at no cost! And that I was welcome to keep the first order - to keep, donate, or gift, as I chose.TeePublic went above and beyond in customer service, which in turn, afforded me the opportunity to make a donation that was greatly appreciated! Five stars, TeePublic! Thank you again, and stay safe and well. (My daughter *loves* your podcast!)Anne B.",0

"This company claims they want their customers to be 100% satisfied but does not offer returns if you are not satisfied with the product. Only a replacement, unless there is a defect. The product is advertised as 100 % cotton but feels like some sort of weird stretchy type of synthetic material. Highly disappointed. So, this is money wasted.",3

"I ordered three tees. The price was very reasonable. The shirts arrived fairly promptly. Two of the three tees were great, just as expected. The third, however, was a disappointment. The lettering was poorly adhered to the surface and a number of letters are damaged. I am not all that picky. But I would not have sent the Lake George New York shirt to a customer. I have always been pleased with TeePublic in the past. I hope that this was an anomaly.",3

"When I ordered my Tee, I was pleased with the correspondence, alerting me that delivery may takea while. That was not a problem. I ordered a light blue ""Be Kind"" tee. I am typically a size 8 and wear a size M. When I received my shirt, it was labeled a M.The problem is that I believe it wasincorrectly sized. I could barely get the shirt on. I was so disappointed that it was so tight. Even the sleeves were tight! Instead of returning the shirt, knowing it would take another 3 1/2 weeks to receive it, I mailed it to my niece who is a size 3.I was also disappointed that the white lettering was so light against the blue color, that it was difficult to see it. I would suggest using a dark contrasting color.",3
"Item arrived on time the week before Christmas. Shirt quality was expected. Design was as pictured. However screen print quality was very poor. Top of screen print is thin, can see shirt through the print, bottom of the print looks better. Disappointed in the overall quality of the shirt.",3

I ordered a bunch of masks for my teenaged grandkids and they LOVED them.They fit well and reflect their personality while staying in school guidelines for attire - always a plus.Only problem I had was with a tee shirt I got for myself.Was a 3x but was so small that my granddaughter who is 15 could wear it.That was disappointing.,3

We have to mount it and then mail it in time to get it to him for Christmas. *I thought I was getting a 18x24"" poster. *The actual picture on the poster is 14 x 16"". The rest of the poster is white border.NOT what I expected!The quality of the paper and picture are nice but I have no use for quality paper that has to be cut off and thrown away.I would normally return it but there isn't enough time to find another like poster in the size I requested.",3
Great T-shirt design!Thank you.,0
"I'm enjoying the art I ordered and it was fun to browse through your selections.Fast delivery: I ordered the end of November and received everything in plenty of time for Christmas giving. No excess packaging, though some was in tyvec-type plastic bags. My art came in a cardboard mailer (yay!).I was warned online that one of the T-shirts I ordered ran small, which was good to know.",1
"Top notch...couldn't ask for better!I ordered two shirts for my sister for Christmas and once I got them (in a very timely manner!) I realized the size wouldn't be right. Having ordered from other such sites, I was afraid I was stuck with them, but customer service couldn't have have been nicer or more helpful. They not only GAVE me the sizes I needed, but they didn't charge me for thenew ones and told me to keep the old ones! They have a customer for life. This is one of the best online shopping experiences I've ever had. And knowing I""m helping independent artists is all the sweeter! Thank you!",0
Recieved my order pretty quickly. Loved the products! Cannot wait to wear them. Had to wrap them as a gift from myself. Will definitely be ordering more!Thank you!,0

"My sticker of my podcast logo was fine but the skin color on the same logo was off on my t-shirt.Edit 7/23/19:I contacted customer service as instructed and received a quick response by the next day. Due to the quality of the initial logo, the shirt could not be reprinted. However, I was offered a replacement with any print of my choice or a refund. I chose a replacement print from the same artist and am eagerly awaiting the t-shirt. I���������m sure that the next shirt will be fine so I updated my rating from 4 to 5 stars in anticipation of that. Thanks so ",0

"Item recieved was not what I expected. For the amount I paid for one, I could have made multiple myself at home. I find it odd that such a simple NZ souviner has to be made in a different country.Overpriced and disappointing to recieve....especially after 37 days from ordering",3

"Wearing My Covid 19 Survivor shirt has been part of a bigger healing process. Thanks for a clean design which helps to open conversations(albeit thru a mask) Being able to tell my story, spread hope and inform others about the virus feels as good as your high quality cotton fabric.I look forward to my second order- Covid Survivor in Spanish!",0
I was a little disappointed with the shirt. I thought it was a low quality tee shirt.,3
"Thank you! The T-shirt I ordered for a Christmas present arrived on time, and was awesome!",0
I ordered 2 tee shirts for my kids birthdays on 5/10/2020 and did not receive them until 06/04/2020 (26 days after the order was placed). So needless we DID NOT receive the tee shirts until after their birthday. That alone is super disappointing. But on top of all that the image on both shirts looked blurry and on top of that I have washed them once and the image is already faded a lot. I paid almost $55 on very bad quality and service. I would NEVER use this website again.,3

"Hello Folks, I recently purchased a mask. I wanted to both protect myself and support artists. I selected one with Owls on it. My Spirit Animal is an Owl. It arrived and is magnificent however one of the ear straps is broken. This may sound like a disappointment but it is quite the opposite. When I showed my pal how beautiful my mask is, he told me about a little girl in our neighborhood. She saw her Grandfather have a bit of trouble with the ear straps of his mask. They were irritating and sometimes came off. She altered it by putting an elastic strap that went around his head. She has since done so for other neighbors. If the straps on my lovely mask were intact I would have been deprived of the joy that this young child is dispensing. So I am thrilled. I got not only a unique mask but a wee bit of magic as well. Thank You and please thank the artist for me. Be way better than well, be happy, Brian",0
Thanks for the cool shirt hope this organization keeps producing lots of cool shirts and logos.,0
I loved it thank you. The T Shirt was great Quality.. I'd order again,0

The T-shirt arrived yesterday. I was so very disappointed. The print on the shirt is just a photocopy. It���������s dull and not clear and the colors look faded.

"Thank you for great customer support!I ordered a tee-shirt for an event scheduled for a conference coming up. When I tracked my order, it had been sent to the wrong address.

The masks took a over a month to come in which I completely understand with Covid however after waiting so long one of the masks was the wrong design and we never received 2 that we ordered.

4th shirt. The fit seems to be true to size but each shirt is stiff and very scratchy. Also the smell is very bad. A strong chemical smell that last past 1st washing. I am soaking the shirts in fabric softner to try and resolve the stiffness. I paid $30 for each shirt after hearing how soft these shirts were. I was disappointed to feel how scratchy they were. And they all were ordered apart from each other on separate orders and all have the same feel and odor.,3

"You mentioned that your t-shirts run small so I ordered a 2X, what I got was a small medium it was labeled 2X but it only went two-thirds of the way across my chest I would have needed to order a 5 or 6X in order to have it fit.

Thank you the quality of the shirts nice though",0

"Top quality sweatshirt, really soft and comfortable. The print was great. I needed an exchange for sizes and these guys let me keep the old ones and simply replaced it free of charge, they even waived my shipping fee from the USA as the size I needed wasn't available to order from in the UK. Absolutely phenomenal. Best company I've ever dealt with hands down. Everything was in perfect order and the purchase journey was seamlessly smooth. Customer service was impeccable, really helpful and speedy responses. Exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended and will certainly be a returning customer. Thank you!",0
"Fantastic quality, easily my new favorite clothes to wear and when it came to issues I had with one of the sizes they very quickly responded. I wasn���������t used to that level of punctuality in customer service, so much so that I was the one who was responding late! Thanks so much, will de",0

"I placed my order for five t-shirts in early November, hoping to get them in time to give as Christmas presents. I tried using the tracking number associated with my shipment, with zero luck. I ended up waiting under February before contacting your customer service to see what had happened. I actually waited that long because I knew there were global supply chain issues due to Covid, etc. Your customer service person waived the delivery fee of $19.00, which was nice. I then had to wait for my order to be shipped again. It took until early March before I received it. I then had to pay an additional $25.00 in duties. When I finally opened the package, three of five t-shirts looked like they had been made in someone's basement. The screen printing was faded in some areas, blurry in others. Two were very nice quality, with clear printing and no blurriness. Overall I was extremely disappointed with my order. I will not be using your company again. The only reason I gave a rating of ""poor"" rather than ""bad"" was your customer service person was very polite and offered to refund the delivery fee.",3
Thank you so much for everything you did for me. You went above and beyond what most people would do. You will be hearing from me more often I need T-shirts for my son���������s 40th birthday and I,0

You all are doing great with how the world is right now. Like getting your things. It would be great if all the Ts were the soft cotton now. Fits so much nicer. Thank you,0
"Received T-Shirt for Grandson who is dressing as his favorite super hero Thursday for school spirit week. Quicksilver items are difficult to find, especially if you're looking for a tee in kids and youth sizes.The tee was also on sale, which help me to justify the air/overnight shipping to ensure I received it on time. Arrived in time and very pleased with the quality of the tee. Thank you",0

"The variety of shirts is great, and I would give a rating of five stars in all areas with two exceptions. I purchased seven shirts before and all were perfect. I just received my most recent order, and I am very disappointed with one of the shirts. The logo is not the right color, and the image is blurry. I found another site similar to TeePublic, and they have the same shirt design with the correct logo color, and the image is not blurry at all. My other issue is now that I found two similar sites, like TeePublic that sell shirts made by individual artists, TeePublic is a couple dollars more than the other sites, and they offer a no questions asked return policy. Now that I know how restrictive TeePublic���������s return policy is, I���������m going to be very car",3

"I was skeptical with some of the reviews I saw but I really wanted it so I took a chance. I ordered a large chocolate rainbow cupcake hoodie in black and it was delivered in 5 days with updates sent the whole time. The print is a little dull compared to the online pic but I understand that it's printed over black so that's to be expected. Anyways, the sizing was perfect too and the material is thick, warm and cozy. Thank you so much for my amazing new hoodie. Can't wait to show it off!",0

"Went to order a t-shirt with the design I wanted. It appears that the t-shirts were only available with a back print, which I did not want. Ordered a sweatshirt instead. Received the sweatshirt and the print was of good quality, but the material was a bit thin (I have a few that used Champion brand, which is a good quality material). So, a bit disappointed in the quality of the material used.",3
Unfortunately disappointed.The logo is not centered & the small print is barely visible with the grey tee.,3

I purchased two shirts. One was the thin purple line (in support of security work) and the other was a Bouncer support shirt that had the letters spelled out with the elements of the periodic table. I found both t shirts quite unique and very creative on both artists part. I am a former Security Officer and Bouncer and I think there is a need to support these professions which are quite under appreciated and at times not respected and sometimes criticized harshly. Bottom line is that both artists put great thought and used great skill in creating each T-shirt. I am somewhat of a frequent customer of Tee Public and I am satisfied every time. Artists are essential! Thank you artists and Tee Public.,0
"Very easy,fast, my t-shirt quality is top notch! Thank you",0
Thank you so much. I have this to someone as a present and they loved it.,0

"Great product. Quick delivery. True to size & picture, couldn't be happier, thank you!",0
Awesome siteGreat designs Perfect giftsThanks!,0
I've found that the fit differs from the tee shirt brand name to brand name. I can't wear a Medium in the Hanes Brand. And I can't wear a Medium in the Gildan brand. Regardless of the measurement. Can you tell us the brand name of the tee shirt you plan to use for the design. That would help me buy a tee shirt that would fit. Thank you for giving me a chance to give my opinion.,0
"Fantastic customer service.I've ordered several times.The latest time, I had an issue with the color printed on the shirt after it arrived.My concerns and questions were answered promptly and professionally.Tee Public and the artist sent out a replacement no problem and it is perfect!These guys back up the product with phenomenal customer service.Many thanks!",0

Extremely happy with my purchase! Would recommend this to anyone looking for great T-shirts! Thank you!,0
I found the shirts that I received were great quality my only complaint was that the bag that shirts came in must have gotten caught in some machinery and one of the shirts was ripped. Maybe if you ship the shirts in a tougher bag or box would have avoided the problem thank you,0
Placed a nice size order great shirts and loved my discounts thank u,0
Thanks. All just as ordered.,0
"Regardless my order was never received by me (apparently was lost in-transit, or miss delivered by USPS during the holiday season), wanted to remark the exceptional customer service that TeePublic has. My refund was processed fast and without hassle. Joe, Jean Marie, Samuel, etc. they all got involved to make sure I was fully satisfied with my experience with the company. I will always consider to place more orders in the future with confidence. 5 stars for your staff TeePublic! Thanks guys and Happy & Successful New Year 2020.",0

Great customer service. The first shirt I ordered didn't fit and they sent a replacement right away. So easy. Just as it should be. Thank you,0
"I ordered a handful of shirts, which took 10 days to arrive (despite a shipping time of 6-8 days), and when tracking showed me that they had not yet shipped, I requested the order be cancelled (I ordered them for a trip, and would not receive them in time), but they billed me the day after my cancellation request and sent the shirts anyway. When I got the order, the shirt about which I was most excited still had part of it's silk-screen template sticker attached and the large graphic was positioned so far off center that the shirt is basically unwearable in public. I've ordered from TeePublic before and was pleased, but this order was disappointing in multiple ways.",3
I love the designs but just wish the shirt's quality was better.Thank you.,0
very happy with my purchase.,1

"I had a slight issue with one of the shirts I ordered. It turned out it was not a defect in the production of the shirt but as they pointed out it was in the original design of the shirt if you look closely. They were correct, however because they thought I was not satisfied they offered me a credit, I told them it wasn't necessary and that I would just keep the shirt. They said okay, keep the shirt and here is the credit towards your next purchase too! It is rare in this day and age to find a company that is responsive to your concerns and more than helpful to resolve them!! Thank you Tee Public couldn't be more professional.Also my wife is not happy with my latest purchase she said it is just asking for trouble... I kind of told here that was the idea!!""""More Respect for Others....""",0

I got my order quickly as promised. I love the designs. Unfortunately 1 of my items was damaged. The customer service is fantastic. I have a replacement on the way and I get to skip the hassle of returning the damaged item. I will continue to shop with you with that kind of customer support. Thank You,0
"Graphics were great!The shirt size is the problem.I ordered a 2XL because I wanted to use it as a sleep shirt.The 2XL looks more like a large or possiblyan XL and I normally buy a size L.I guess I should have ordered a 4X to get the size I wanted. Other than being aware of how small the shirts are, the graphics are great.Stephan has contacted me and I have sent photos of the shirt I received. Hopefully we can resolve the issue.

The printing on the hoodie I ordered was bad.The lettering was broken where it was not properly pressed.I can't imagine that someone did not see this prior to mailing out.I would rather had not received the order than to receive this poor quality print! The T-shirt I ordered the print looks great but the size of XL youth is small. It is not like other Youth XL I have ordered from other sites.Very disappointed!,3
The shirt came just as advertised and in a timely manner.Step-son is very happy.,1
My shirts came with blue ink stains! Very disappointing!,3

I had a tee shirt that was defective. The company rushed a replacement. I am so happy with my many purchases and customer service.,1
The shirt that I ordered is a birthday present. I am very disappointed about the quality. It is a little bit faded and on a very thin shirt. In order for it to arrive in time for the birthday I had to pay extra to have it shipped. Unfortunately though the product did not live up to the cost. I'm not sure if I will be ordering from teepublic again.,3
The customer service is outstanding. I had an issue with a size I ordered and they replaced it! Thank you!,0
Ordered 2 shirts the same color and they were different tones...shirt sizes are smaller than the actual size. Do not recommend. The colors are very faint. Very disappointing!!!,3
One of the t-shirts has a big hole in the arm. Customer service replied in 2 days stating a replacement is being sent. I took one star off because two out of five of the shirts I ordered don���������t have a sharp image. I agree with ordering a size up for women�,6
Product was as advertised and on time. I am happy.,1
Very Happy with our tees love that you can choose any design you want! Thank You and will recommend to friends!!,0
"Outside of some shipping issues, which wasn't Teepublic's fault, my order was perfect. I'm super happy with my tee and pretty much buying out their whole shop now.",1
"The shirt I ordered had a typo on it.I contacted customer service and was told that is how it is advertised on the website and sure enough it is.Why would you sell a shirt with a misspelled word on it?The customer service person was nice enough to send me any other shirt I wanted, but I was very disappointed not to be able to wear the shirt I ordered.I feel like I was tricked.",3
Super happy with my order. The size was on point and the quality of the print and shirt were great! Thank you!,0
"I placed an order and TeePublic had my old address on file, which is where the order was delivered.Completely my mistake.I emailed them and let them know that I couldn't pick my order up from the old home.I received a second order in less than two days.Absolutely overjoyed.You have earned a loyal customer by providing outstanding service.Thank you.",0

"I ordered 6 t-shirts, 6 different artist,I had never heard of this website. Just stumbled on it by accident. I will say you did not disappoint.I absolutely love everyone of them. Thank you!! I will be ordering more.",0
Graphics looked good but these shirts run really small! I normally wear a ladies M/L and ordered a L for myself and an XL for my daughter.I am going to have to keep the XL for myself and return the L and order her a lot larger size! Bummer :(,3

"Fast delivery,good good quality shirts and at a fair price too. Thank you.",0
Ordered t-shirts for vacation and paid extra for fast shipping (4-7 business days) to assure they were here on time for me to take on vacation. I was notified on the 7th day that they would not be delivered until the 8th day (tomorrow) - the t-shirts would be delivered a day later than what I paid for resulting in not being able to take the t-shirts with me on vacation. This is disappointing and frustrating since I paid extra for express shipping and did not receive the t-shirts.,3
"nice quality lost my tees but they sent replacement, now thats customer service thank you",0
"Quick delivery and great product.The B-17 picture ""almost home"" is excellent, and the picture blends in well with the color of the high quality t shirt. Thanks!",0

I was so excited when I ordered but was very disappointed with how faint the picture was & it was so small. Not worth $30 I would have tired to return it if I would have got the bigger size like I was at first. The quality of it just wasn't it.,3

This was the first time I had placed an order with Tee public. Overall I was very pleased with my purchase. However I was disappointed with their sizing chart. It was difficult to follow and although the T-shirts we ordered fit we would have liked to have more room in them. They did not align with standard sizes for women so it was difficult to judge.,3
The shirts came in lovely andexactly what we ordered! The sizes just run a touch too small so I recommend ordering a size up. Will be purchasing from this company again. Thank you!,0

I ordered two extra large t shirts and they are clearly not the size I was expecting. They are far toooo small.Very disappointed.,3
I didn't get to support an artist because they were taken down on your site for no reason. They won't get a profit off of me and you will reap the benefits. Super disappointed with the way your handling the influx of artists trying to make money.,3
Everything came in a timely manner and exactly as advertised.I have purchased more since my first order.Thanks,0
Tracking numbers given are pretty much useless; the tees arrived out of the blue and in a brightly-branded package that the gift recipient picked up from our mailbox instead of me. Thanks for that. I'm still waiting for the stickers that were part of the order and have no idea when they'll arrive because the useless tracking says they haven't moved for days.,0
Love the shirt. Perfect size. Comfy material. Swift delivery. Thank you,0
I love my shirt it is beautiful!!!Thank you!I highly recommend!!!,0

"We bought a couple patriotic shirts. Shipping schedule was expected to be borderline on getting there by Jul 4. They were only a day late. Given my late submission, I'm happy the shirts weren't several days late. Was still able to enjoy wearing one the day after as most people are celebrating Jul 4 weekend, not just one day. Got V-necks and the 100 percent cotton appears to be in great quality.",1

"I got the t-shirt in record speed and I was extremely pleased with the design, happy to support",1
The shirt was very long for an XL. The picture was also placed too low. The neck seemed very stretched out and was too wide. Unfortunately not impressed at all with the quality and product. Disappointed with it.,3
The shirt was the right size and exactly what I expected and couldn���������t be any happie,6
Thank you for making tee shirts that express how I�������,0

"I placed an order for two products, and when one item arrived in the package was concerned that the smaller item may have been missed.I contacted TeePublic's customer care team, and was reassured that the item was in transit and given a due date for arrival.The second item was delivered within the timeframe supplied by customer care, and both are fabulous.I'm a very happy customer Thank you TeePublic!����",0
"Very friendly,color and print are accurate.Size seems right,will know more after it's washed,but very pleased so far!",6
I ordered a shirt for my wife and I it was a little too small and I chose a unflattering color for her. I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to get a replacement for my order. Thank you so much for great customer service!,0
I enjoy my new shirt and look forward to seeing what some other stuff will be like.,1
"The artwork and silkscreen on the shirts was mediocre at best, and ultimately disappointing. Would not buy again.",3
I love your shirts . Shipping is always fast thank you,0
Excellent quality and just right for the occasion! Thank you,0
I wish there could be something in front of shirt also I think it would like better & nicer. Thanks do like the shirt �����,0
"Great designs, good quality, reasonable price and shipping.Thanks",0
I was disappointed that the pictures were so faded ( but I���������m his Mom so I might be a bit biased ���������������������������������������,3
"Quality T, but also soft. Colors are vibrant and making the t-shirt was fun!",1
All shirts were too small. I ordered my normal size and they were too tight. Disappointed,3
Excellent service. The print on a t-shirt stated to peel after one use. The team replaced it with no questions asked. Thank you.,0
"I got 5 sticker and 3 tee's in my order. The sticker came right way and are incredible. The tee shirt took the entire 15days to arrive, not a problem,the staff keep me informed. Much appreciated. The reason for not being 5 stars is the one shirt I got was for a girl and I got it in a girl size. When the shirt came and it was for barbie XL not real life girl XL. VERY disappointing",3
Well done. Thanks.,0
"Hey guys, so I was quite disappointed with the quality of print on this t-shirt. It seemed like a fuzzy, out of focus inkjet print of some kind, instead of the sweet one-color silk screen press that the design looked like online. Its clearly meant to be a single color print design (all black ink), and I got it on a red shirt, and some of the negative spaces are actually randomly printed white! Perhaps its my fault for not deducing a better idea of what the final product would look like. The t-shirt itself is quite nice, good fabric, etc. But yeesh. I feel like a paid a quality price (30 bucks + tax for a kids t-shirt), and got a subpar print that I would have never paid for if seen in person.",3
"Edit: I haven���������t been able to wear the shirt other than a quick try on. Just a bit ago I was folding it and I saw a hole in the sleeve. Not only is it overly small, not the most comfortable material, but it���������s also low quality material that isn���������t sewn at the seams well. Completely disappointed bc I���������ve been waiting for this shirt for over a month just to be let down.The pictures on the shirts turned out great but even after following the sizing photos and the suggestion to go up a size or two in my normal shirt I felt my shirt was way too tight around the waist without any give. I like my clothes to be a bit more loose fitting. My husband got a shirt and he bounces in between a L and XL, so to play it safe we got an XL. It looks huge and long on him. But my XL is skin tight and looks child sized. I���������m half his size by the way and not a large woman. Because of the inconsistency of the sll have to shop at other retailers that offer free returns and exchanges. Also his shirt was very soft and mine was scratchy and not as cozy as I would have hoped. I wish the artists would use one or two different brands of shirts so you know what you may be getting in terms of size and feel.",3
Emails are responded to within 1 business day. Very accommodating and easy to work with. Website is very user friendly. I will definitely order more from your site. Thank you.,0
"I get so many compliments on my T-shirt Delivery was fast, I'm totally satified. Thank you",0
Fast shipping great shirts and 4x for a big guy that's awesome thank you for supporting veterans,0
The t-shirt took two weeks to arrive as this was a gift money was taken out of my account immediately and put into UPS expedited shipping without my authority period with the extra price for shipping it was more than the t-shirt it arrived late anyway period and I had a pay more period and then this person's birthday there for the gift not arriving on time also how I order the shirt on one day and the next day when it shipped it was $14 and set $13 when I originally ordered it all I will not be ordering anything from this company again- I wish I could write the reply. Thanks for your kindness and worriness. And thanks for the reminder about how hard it is for deliveries to be delivered around Christmas time that's why I did it earlier. That's why I thought expedite shipping from the UPS not the postal service and expedited it would be not a problem and considering you charge me for expedited shipping without my request. So it arrived on the regular timely fast and it would have arrived. But you charged more now I have to read your response... Yeah thanks. I don't even think a human being responded to that. Thanks but no thanks much love thoughts and prayers,0
Awesome! Thank you,0
Really happy with the shirts I ordered. One arrived with an ink line outside the design area but was quickly replaced with a perfect one. Thanks to the excellent customer service I will certainly be ordering more in the future!!,0
It took awhile to receive my tees; just over 2 weeks. But I���������m really happy with the products. These are tees that are basically made to my order. Shir,1
Thank u love my shirt will continueto shop wth u guys,0
The quality of the product was terrible.I clearly ordered adult shirts and I think we received junior sizes.I was very disappointed and will not order again from your company.It really is a shame because your customer service gets an A+.,3
"I wear a medium shirt, sometimes small in adult sizes. I ordered a medium and it fits my 8 year old daughter. Very disappointed. Also, when I have gotten shirts from here in the past the design starts to come off in just a few washes. Very disappointing, and very expensive for the quality of the image longevity and the t-shirt material. I just bought my own design cut out machine for $300. At $25 a pop for TeePublic, I can make about 4 shirts for that price now with better quality iron on and t-shirt material. Whatever their screening material is it is terrible. Washes off fast.",3
"I was very happy with my purchase (T-shirt), it came in a week and I love the fit and material. I ordered another one for my brother the same day I received mines. Thank you!!!",0

"I ordered a T-shirt from TeePublic as a Christmas gift for a friend who I hadn't seen in a while.I did see her shortly before the holiday and after receiving the shirt, realized that the size I ordered might be too small for her.I contacted Michael, a representative who went ahead and processed my order for a larger size shirt and told me I didn't need to return the original one, that I could keep or donate it.I had no hope or assurance that the replacement would arrive by Dec. 25th but it did in fact arrive in the mail a couple of days before Christmas.As a result of your prompt attention to the matter, I was able to deliver both gifts to my friend on Christmas day, as a Scorpio, she was thrilled with the design of the phoenix on the shirt, and it made what might have been a disappointing experience really special as well as increasing the likelihood that I will be doing business with you in the future.Thanks again, TeePublic!!",0

"I really like the designs and the ability to pick what color and quality t-shirt/hoodie you want; however, two of my recent orders were messed up. One I ordered a medium and received a large. The other, the quality of the print was bad (orange was yellow and art blurry). This is really disappointing because I really like the designs offered from this website but not sure it is worth waiting to receive and then having to go through the filing a complaint process. They happily fix but something needs to be done about quality control.",3

"Ordered a t-shirt and mug with the same image (1963 GMC) for my husband. Both looked great and my husband agreed. He is just under 6'4"" and about 200 pounds.

"I would like to start off by saying that the intended wording on the 3 adult face masks that I ordered was so cool, but, for me, the masks were huge and the wording was sewn so that you can���������t even read the message.

"one of my shirts had a big stain :( I had ordered 4 shirts and 3 of them looked great and the print quality was nice, but one of them looks like the screen print got in another part of the shirt. I attempted to clean it but it didn't budge. Its a huge bummer because the shirt is white too.",3

I ordered a number of different masks of different designs.I was very disappointed because I ordered pleated masks and discovered that the designs on them were hidden or distorted by the pleats.That was not how the pictures appeared on the website.,3

Product received late after themed birthday party but was glad to get full refund,1
"I've gotten four shirts from them, and the quality of them has been absolutely horrible. All of them look like they were printed with an ink cartridge that needed to be changed months ago. Clearly visible vertical lines in all of the prints, color that comes off in random spots after a single wash. The majority of the design on one of the shirts wasn't even visible when I got it. They let me pick a different design as a replacement, but again, it looked like they printed it with a cartridge that was nearly out of ink. I'm very disappointed, because they have a lot of designs on their site that I would love to have on shirts, but because of the fact that 100% of the shirts I've gotten from them have been such poor quality, I will not be purchasing anything from them in the future.",3
Good service. Thank you,0
Very pleased! Great quality prints! Delivered as promised! Thanks,0
"I LOVE my shirts. I got the heavy cotton tees in 4x men's size. The sizing is right on the money, the construction is high quality, and the design is clear and well made! Thanks you for putting out an excellent product at a reasonable price! I will be back!",0

The colour of the Snoopy Christmas print was very poor. What should have been Christmas red was more an insipid orange colour. Very disappointing compared to the colour shown on the web page.,3
"The sweatshirt I ordered is really nice quality.I'm very, very happy with it.Customer service was amazing! Definitely 5 stars. Thank you!",0
"Once TeePublic customer service representatives ensured that I understood their return policy and reviewed the evidence of the defective tee shirt, they were more than courteous and apologetic about the trouble I'd had to go through and arranged for a replacement right away.I was struck by the personal tone they'd taken and the speed with which they addressed the situation.Many thanks!",0
T-shirt is cheap. There are other sites that offer better quality. Delivery took 9 weeks. Very disappointing.,3

"Design is very nice but the final product does not looks neat as the picture, needless to say the ultra cheap quality of the t-shirt, plenty of wrinkles and dirty (very), there is no way to use it without a wash. I guess you can have better options, since I paid in total more than $30 for the product. I still like the design very much, so if you have a decent t-shirt to print (clean and neat), please let me know. Thank you!",0
"Always enjoy Tee-public & new artist's designs, and classic retro rock designs as well. Great experience.",1
"I was very pleased with my T-shirt.We have traveled the Alaska Highway 20 times and always stop at Sasquatch Crossing (a restaurant, gas station, hotel along the highway in British Columbia, Canada.)I 've wanted that exact design that I was able to get from you--the Sasquatch in a yellow diamond.It was perfect and I don't have to look for one anymore.Thank you.Also my T-shirt arrived quickly and in good shape.Thanks again.",0
Very happy with the quality of the shirts and stencils.,1
"I bought a t-shirt and a pullover hoodie. The graphics on the t-shirt look cheap and worn, as does the t-shirt itself. The graphics on the hoodie are a sky blue color and was printed poorly as well. Graphics on both garments should be a royal blue color. Im am very disappointed and will never purchase anything from this seller again.",3

I have tried to reach out this company via email to exchange items I���������ve bought and I have not received any response in almost over a week. There is no other way to contact this company. I almost feel I just lost out on $55 on tshirts that won���������t be used. If I could give 0 stars,3
The T-shirts I ordered are good quality. Print quality appears to be very good. Exactly what I ordered and expected. Thank you!,0
I was really looking forward to receiving my shirt. The tshirt material was not what I was expecting. I wore it one time and it tore from the sleeves. I was very disappointed,3

"My sweatshirt is my favorite item of clothing: soft, durable, and vibrant. Thank you!",0

"Absolutely brilliant! I order as size up and it fits amazing. Super comfy. And the delivery was quicker than I thought, especially in the UK. Thanks artists! I'd definitely get it again!",0
"The shirts are wonderful with great designs and are extremely comfortable. Definitely worth the purchase. In regards to other aspects, there was a point when I backed out on a purchase for a friend, opting to go in a different direction after asking for his opinion. The process of cancelling the existing order was painless and simple and I'm glad for it. My only issue was that at the same time I ordered the shirts I also purchased several sets of stickers of other designs I liked, and despite being ordered together, were shipped separately and arrived almost two weeks after the shirts. The point of the purchase was the shirts, which as mentioned are great! But it is rather disappointing that everything didn't arrive together.",3

"It's so beautiful! Wonderful concept well executed. And the colors are top notch! The fit is good. The shirt color selection is very nice, especially the pink, but blue could be a brighter in the women's as in the men's but that would be my only complaint. Thanks so much to the independent artist for creating this masterpiece.",0

Ordered 2 T-shirts and a sticker in late November. One shirt was supposed to be a 2XL and the other a 3XL. Sticker never arrived. Finally received shirts today. The print was good and liked the shirts fine. Except they were both XL. Very disappointing. Will probably never order from them again.,3

"I really like the designs. The price was awesome. The delivery time was longer than I expected- but when I consider that I ordered from several different designers, then I understood. I ordered 13 shirts.I was disappointed in 2 of the shirts. The Mathelete shirt did not look good at all. There was not enough contrast between the color of the shirt and the print, so ""Mathelete"" gets lost and looks low quality. The Purrist shirt is such an awesome design and it was so bright on the web page, but the screenprinting process was very blotchy and the design turned out very dull, it was the shirt I was most excited about and my biggest disappointment. These are Christmas gifts and I do not have time to reorder now(received them yesterday) so now I have to buy another gift somewhere else.",3

"The refrigerator magnet I ordered was so tiny you couldn't even read the details, and the material, instead of being metal, was like one of those cheesy store magnets you get from Dominoes.I was very disappointed. It's almost like you went out of your way to spend the tiniest amount of money you could get away with and still bilk me for full price. Never order from you guys again.Got a NICE metal magnet from Cafe Press for about the same price.",3

"I���������ve ordered from here a few times , my last order there was a mixup on my part on what size I needed , I got in touch with the company and they graciously are sending me the correct size , I want to say thank you very much for sendin",0
The real disappointment was the delivery and the lack of transparency regarding delivery on their website. I contacted the customer services and was told it was with the royal mail however the notifications on USPS tracker told a different story. I will not be using this site again even if and when things back to normal. The masks themselves are fine. It just everything else with the TeePublic is the issue.,3
Had a question about an order and the customer service section was great fast and efficient. Thank you,0
The shirts that ordered were better than I had expected and I received them quicker than anticipated as well.Thanks a bunch!,0
We wanted something for our son that was unique and personal. His Thor T-shirt that he has had for 15 years was in shreds. So we were thankful to find a replacement on your website. Thank you,0

Was great thanks. Will probably buy from again.,0
Thank you. Love the shirt.,0
"merchandise was great good price quickdelivery, thank you!",0
"I purchased a Doctor Who hoodie from TeePublic and I'm not too happy with it. I love Doctor Who and have been a long-time fan of the show so I was ecstatic to order this. The hoodie was almost $45 so for that price I was expecting it to be a better quality. The faces of the doctors came out looking very distorted, almost like the faces melted during the transfer process, they really looked nothing like the Doctor's at all which was very disappointing. I washed the hoodie before wearing it, I turned the hoodie inside out and followed the washing instructions. Well, the fabric just pilled up in the wash, I didn't know if I was going to have a sweater left after I saw all that loose shredded-up fabric in my washer. I let the sweater air dry on a hanger, I wasn't going to take a chance of the dryer shredding it further or melting the design worse than it already was. When I was finally able to wear the sweater it was a little snug. I ordered a 3x because I like my sweaters baggy, I usually wear a 2x but decide to order a size up after thoroughly reading the size chart on the website. I should have ordered a 4x because the sweater was fitting like a 1x. I'm not very happy and want to exchange it for all these problems but it took a week to arrive so I can't even imagine how long it would take to return it.",3
Great service and mighty fine products! Thanks Corrie,0

My partner wants one of a different design from the same seller, but unfortunately there's no case option for Samsung galaxy S8+, and the S8+ is larger, but can't use a S9 case. Bummer!

I received the item in time for my grandsons birthday and he loves it. Thanks!!,0
I really enjoy the product and with a quick delivery was awesome,1
My t-shirt is nice but it is seriously small for a size medium. My other t-shirts are all mediums so i was confident in ordering a medium. This medium is really small though and there is no way I can use it. Very disappointing.,3
I really enjoyed the TeePublic buying experience- the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars- is because they had no option to group all shipments together. I'd rather save money on shipping- so I can spend more on the artists.,1
Nice weight shirt and the graphic of the aircraft I worked on in the Air Force was top notch. Thanks,0

The designs that are screen printed/vinyl whatever material is used, actually were good. But having a nice design on a crappy tshirt doesnt work well.

"The hoodie that I purchased was very nice. The only minor problem is that the white color was a bit translucent and ended up being pink with the red of the hoodie. That's OK as she likes pink bunnies too! The size is correct and the hoodie was a bit heavier than I thought it would be, That's good because it will be a winter wear item.",6

Several purchases and 100% happy with them all...,1
"We were disappointed when we receive our sweatshirt. My daughter picked it out for a good friend's birthday. Little did I know the logo was silk screened onto a scratchy $5 Gildan sweatshirt.

I almost put a claim in, I thought the package was lost when there was no movement?",3

The t shirt I ordered was a great design but so cheaply made. I thought the sizing was off. I ordered a xl and it looked to be a med/large. The screen print was pealing in spots. Very disappointed. A last minute Christmas gift that I didn't have time to return. Never again.,3
great products and fast shipping . Thanks Heaps :),0
Shirts looked exactly as I saw on the website and came really quickly too! Thanks Teepublic for the smooth delivery,0
"The design was nice and colorful (although slightly crooked - was it supposed to be that way?) The quality of the shirt itself was disappointing. Not very thick material. The bottom of the tank is already starting to curl up, right after just trying it on. Having not even worn it for any about of time, and even with it laying flat, was not expecting or desiring the curling.",3

"Arrived a couple of days late but no harm, no foul. Arrived as described. THANKS!",0
Love the designs available but the inconsistency in the t-shirt quality is a bummer. I ordered a premium that wasn't the nice thick type I typically get which was a disappointment. When I reached out to support I was basically told types can vary and it is what it is.,3
The design of the Max Verstappen helmet is very washed out looking.You can actually see the black hoodie material thru the white on the helmet. Disappointed in quality. Considering this was his only thing on the list he gave me.,3
"Thank you so much! My sister works for the Post Office, so the Postal Worker Tee was a perfect Christmas gift for her! It arrived very quickly, and in perfect condition. The size was just right. She loved it!",0
"2 issues that really are a problem for me - 1) the sizes are not even close to what they claim.- I had them re-send me a different cut, etc - I ordered it 2 sizes larger than the size I needed, but it JUST fits! - and my second issue is that this new shirts material is very thin and cheap feeling - like what you get at one of those 2 for $5 tee shirt places at the tourist traps... I am giving a ZERO star for the product and a 4 star for the Customer service which was very good I have to say esp in this day and age. - but the quality of the product and the sizes are just not enough for me to return... if CS is reading this - I'd really appreciate a refund at this point... Thanks",0

"Quality was much lower than expected.I would return it if I could, but it's not worth the hassle and return shipping cost. I paid an extra $14 for fast shipping only to be really disappointed by the quality of the emblem.I can tell if it's poor silkscreen or a really poor quality iron on, but either way, I won't be purchasing again.",3

My most recent order is really poor quality compared to previous orders. The logo is blurry on both sides and cut off at the bottom on the back.,3
Not very happy with the quality. The picture on the t-shirt and hoodie I ordered looked like it was stretched out to fit onto the t-shirt and hoodie and is very pixellated and blurry. It's hard to even make-out the wording and characters on the shirt. Disappointed.,3
"Great design, except the shirt I was sent has one shoulder visibility wider than the other and the graphic is SO FAR OFF-CENTER that I noticed it as soon as I unfolded my shirt!So incredibly disappointing... unless the shirt can be exchanged for free - will not recommend this company or use them ever, again.",3

"Using Covid-19 is not an excuse for poor customer service. While we understand that delays have been occurring on getting merchandise shipped, the lack of communication around such shipping issues was more concerning. After an initial email that said the order was received, it took them more than a month before they finally acknowledged that they had a problem with my order, and only after I reached out to them to ask where the order was. If the company knew that such issues were occurring, they should have done a better job at pro-actively notifying customers and allowing them to seek alternatives. Instead, an order that was meant to be a birthday gift was not delivered on time, disappointing my son.",3

"I am pretty disappointed with the sweatshirt I received. It is poorly made, it wasn't black, but some faded dark brown. The size is way off. I ordered a 3xl and couldn't even get it on. It fits my son perfectly who wears a men's small. The hood tie string didn't have any aglets on it and was frayed. The graphic was poorly applied and bubbled on the hoodie and t-shirts. The color of the graphics did not match the site at all and were very faded.Shipping took a very long time.",3
"Thank You Very Much, order was quick, correct, and I am Happy with everything",0
"Really quick delivery, thanks to yall !",0
Very happy with the t-shirts will definitely visit & purchase from again,1

Items came quickly and packaged well. There were no tears or issues or delays. I am super happy because they were all presents.,1
Incredible service. I will pass on the good word about your company.Thank you,0
"My order experience was perfect! My products were what I ordered and exactly like the description. Both of my items were band logos and they were spot on! I was kept informed through the entire process. And shipping was super fast. The hoodie I purchased was a little more bulky in the arms/arm pit area than I had hoped for, I wasn't sure what the brand was. But that issue was the manufacturer of the shirt itself, not the artist. I am super happy with my items. I would definitely recommend and I will be purchasing again in the future! Thank you!",0
"Thank you so much for providing great products! I also thank all of the artisans for the awesome designs! I thoroughly enjoy all of the shirts that I have purchased (35 so far), with several of them being given as gifts to friends. Each one brings with it a fun and fond memory, from the Kaiju Gojira, to the Devastator Transformer, to the Black Beard's Morale Improvement Beatings. I would like to add that the t-shirts are very well made, using top quality material. They are super soft, look great and are sold at a good price. I have shared TeePublic.com with a good number of my friends and colleagues, telling them this is the place to go if you want some really cool and unique t-shirts, and that there are thousands of designs to choose from. I will definitely keep coming back for more shirts, as long as you all keep providing them for us.Again, thank you so very much! ~LR",0
Tees are great! I would buy more if my wife would let me!!! Thanks,0
Amazing Art work!! My husband is a 240Z Sports car lover. I searched on the internet for him a special Z Car t-shirt for Christmas and found it here!! I will order from their special team of artists again. Shirts run true to size and my husband loves the art work of his favorite 240Z's!! Thank you!1,0
"Although I was happy with the design, the placement on the shirt was disappointing. On a v-neck, a full-size print should only be 1 1/2��������� from the point of the V. On the shirt I received, the design was over 3������",3

I can't even begin to tell you how great your customer service is.My recent item showed up in a darker shade of the color than what appeared on the website making the black text/print nearly impossible to see.Within 5 minutes of my inquiry a new order in a lighter color was placed on my behalf at no charge.Thank you thank you!!,0

"Really nice women's style t-shirt and great service!Because this style t-shirt usually runs small I ordered a size larger than normal. It was still too small and I contacted TeePublic about exchanging it for a larger size. They wrote back immediately to tell me they were sending a larger size AND that I could keep the other t-shirt for myself or to give it away. Wow! Never heard of a company doing that before! The larger t-shirt arrived about a week later in time for Christmas too! Thank you, TeePublic!

I've found some unique comic book shirts on TeePublic.The quality has been good so far.They also have the option for the customer to select different background colors for the shirts which is a nice feature.I guess the only disappointment I have is the following shirt is no longer available.They should probably keep all their designs on file forever and print the shirts on demand.Vintage Retro Bronze Age Avengers Cover Thanos Endgame sold by Osprey,3

Half of my order is what I expected but the other half of the shirts are giant! I ordered female classic cut and all look good but they grey ones are just regular Gildan t shirts.

I have ordered plenty of grey shirts before and never got these crappy ones ever!,3

UPS 'said'it was left by the front door..probably in full view of the public I imagine. I assume it was stolen. I emailed TeePublic in anger and explained what had happened.Without hesitation TeePublic arranged to ship a replacement and absorbed all costs incl shipping. Amazing !

I will return for more shopping and I strongly suggest to visit their website and shop with confidence knowing that TeePublic provide an excellent customer and after sales service. They turned a disappointing event into a positive lasting experience. Thank you !,0

The colors red and white Santa Clause hat should never be painted with brown and gray.There is no lot variation of white that should end up with gray.The same with bright red should never turn out to be brown.This company has a very poor quality expectation for itself.I would never order from this company again.,4
My wife is very happy with the tee that I purchased for her.I will pay a little more for a better quality and unique tee versus adding to a corporations bottom line.,1

"The MARCELINE'S ROCK SHIRT FOR PB shirt looks great, it was printed well and the details showed in the design are perfect, however, the POSE | Giorno Giovanna shirt was not printed as well as the other shirt. It looks like the printer was starting to run out of ink or something because I can see there are little white lines in the design when I look at it. I am slightly disappointed by this considering I paid roughly 20 dollars for the shirt so I expected good quality print wise.",3

Colors don't look right. Looks like a cheap knock off.,4
"The designs on the shirts were very cute. My husband and I thought they were very unique. Although, the men's small is a bit smaller than other men's small I've ordered. I'm worried that I may need a men's medium based on how the small fits already.I am updating my review today because of the loyalty TeePublic has to its customers. After reading my review, they responded and assisted me right away to ensure I received what I was looking for all the while providing quality customer service. They went out of their way (above and beyond, I tell yah) for me, just to make sure I was a satisfied customer. And after all that, YES, I am very much satisfied.Thank you TeePublic! :)",0

They were dull and kinda dingy looking. The colors were not as vibrant as they were when advertised on the site. All in all, I spent 63 bucks for 1 tee and 1 hoodie during a supposed sale... Won't do that again.",3
Took a little while to make it all the way to Australia but I anticipated that and the wait was worth it. Good quality and great print. Thanks,0
"Shirt fits well and print is crisp, however a tad thinner than I would like for the price. Still happy to have purchased!",1
The designs let ok even better in person. I am so happy with the print. The size of the shirts aren't to bad but would augg at going 1 size bigger if you are like me and like the baggy looking style.,1

"Thank you so very much for replacing the t-shirt that I originally ordered for my husband, for a bigger size. I knew even though he liked the one I ordered, he was somewhat disappointed because it was too snug.When I contacted your company with my issue, you offered to replace it with a larger sized at no cost, not even shipping. I have never had that type of service extended to me anywhere. You guys are amazing and make it worth it and pleasant to order from your company. My husband was ecstatic when he received the t-shirt in his larger-actually better fitting sized. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Looking forward to my next purchase.-Luz (extremely satisfied customer)",0

"I have bought two orders from here. The first order was awesome, shirts were high quality prints were great. I just got my second order and I have to say I am super disappointed, the prints are all really thin you can see vertical lines on all the prints it really makes them look super cheap. I guess it's hit or miss. They are great with shipping. So just a heads up.",3

Found you guys off Pinterest and its exactly what I was looking for.I wanted to surprise my husband with the supra merchandise to match his car for his birthday. It didn't come on time but he was happy with it overall and thats all that matters. So thank you!,0
"Shirts were easy to order, with fun designs. I was pretty disappointed to get an email before Christmas that they wouldn't arrive on time even though I had ordered pretty early. Shirts actually did arrive a couple days before Christmas after all, so that worked out ok. Print is good, but the colors faded a little after only one wash. Sizes run super small. I bought these as jammies so I thought I was being generous when as a sz 22 woman I ordered a 3xl women's shirt. The shirt fits me very snug, like maybe a unisex XL normally does. All in all, not a terrible experience. I might order from them again, but it will depend on how the print on these wears. I would definitely order bigger. Really disappointed in the sizing and I used to run a screen print shop so I am familiar with how sizing works.",3

"Delivery took about a month which was communicated clearly. There was an issue with the post office where they received it at my local post office but took a week to actually deliver it. Customer support with TeePublic took longer than anticipated to email back but that was also communicated so it was not a surprise. Overall, customer support was as prompt as they could be due to volume and successfully answered questions. Order came and it was a great design/fit. Only issue was with the post office which is not TeePublic's fault. Thank you for the order!",0

"T-shirt material is decent, but the printed design is much duller and less vibrant than I expected. Pretty disappointed in that respect. Brand new shirt but the design looks dull and faded like I've had it for a while and washed it many times.

This Silver Peak Lodge/Kodiak Valley (Hot Tub Time Machine) hoody is PERFECT. Thanks!!,0
The sexism inherent in the fast-fashion industry is definitely here. Women's shirts are priced higher and very small - I previously ordered a unisex medium and a large women's classic and the large women's was definitely smaller than the unisex. So I ordered again a unisex medium and a XL women's and it was still smaller than the unisex. Frustrating because I need the bottom of the shirt to flare slightly to fit my hips. I do love the designs and supporting my favorite podcasters. I'm just disappointed.,3

I got just what I wanted.Thank you,0

"The shirts arrived sooner than I expected and the email notification of their delivery was much appreciated. The quality of the tee shirts is good. The prints are clear. The only drawback at this point is that a couple seem to have the print slightly skewed. Regardless they are just what I was hoping to find. The color selection was quite nice, though it would have been nice to have a few more color selections for the ladies. These will be gifts (and we are keeping 2) for a group of friends who are getting together to play D and D over 3 or 4 days for the first time in 40 years. We are an original group who worked from the rules set out as articles in a gaming magazine, some time before the first manuals were printed. I have no idea how the shirtswill wash but will instruct folks to turn inside out, wash in cold water on gentle cycle and hang to dry to reduce shrinkage.

"I ordered a t-shirt and mug as a Christmas present for my grandson on December 12. The purchase was charged to my credit card (through PayPal), but I never received email confirmation of the order from TeePublic. Everywhere on your site I go to ask about the order, I am asked for an order number, but since I never received email confirmation of the order I don't have an order number. I hope you can take care of this problem (assuming there is a problem) quickly, as I want my grandson to receive his gift by Xmas. Thank you, Sophia Unger",0

"I recently ordered a shirt off of this website. I am completely happy with it. It is a really funny shirt and well made. The problem is that i ordered a medium and i was sent an XL. It says on the package that it should be a medium so thats how i know i ordered a medium. I do not want a refund or anything, as it was more of a gag gift. Im just letting you know that i was not sent the correct size. Thank you for listening.",0

"Great communication, fast shipping, and a great product! Thanks y�����",0
"My buying experience was great, the shirt was on sale, shipping wasn���������t that expensive, but honestly I was disappointed in the design on the shirt. When it arrived the picture of the people on the shirt had what looked like random scratches on it like a rustic, old look. When I purchased the shirt I did not notice that. When I went back into the picture of the shirt on the website after receiving the shirt, I noticed those marks on the design after I zoomed in on the picture. I shouldn���������t have had to zoom in on the picture to see that. I���������",3

"The variety and quality of TeePublic's art-on-tees is amazing, and I appreciated that when I received the shirts, they appear well made which equals longevity... I enjoy shirts that have cool or funny designs or phrases that make other people smile or laugh.I often get the ""cool shirt"" comments when out and about.Lastly, due to cancer reasons,I have gained a lot of weight in the past year, so finding shirts for my current size is remarkable, comforting and very pleasing.I am a happy camper for sure.",1
My shirt for my daughter was way to small(sizes run really small). I let them know and they sent me a new larger size. Very happy with how easy it was.,1
Way to high priced for 5 refrigerator magnets. Would not buy anything here again bigger rip off than Ebay. Item was not described well,4

This is annoyingThis type of thing could become very annoying to buyers if being asked all the time and being reminded when not ansering you first review request.,5

"Very disappointed! I ordered a baseball type tshirt white with red sleeves and ""In a world full of grinches be a Cindy Lou Who!"" on it. I bragged to my daughter-in-law how perfect it was for her. The day came it arrived I grabbed it out of the mailbox and rushed it over to her without opening it. I proudly handed the package to her, she ripped it open and pulled out the ugliest long sleeve dingy dark gray long sleeve tshirt with the correctsaying on it amazingly but faded so you had to get right up close to read the words on it. Did not scream happy holidays at all, more like a Christmas nightmare. It's one of those unrepairable moments.",3
"Thank you for the great shirts.I am totally please with the size, quality and delivery speeds. Definitely a trustworthy vendor.",0
Color is great. Image on the shirt is great. I ordered a 3xl because my boyfriend is very tall. The shirt is 3xl WIDE not in length. Very disappointed this shirt will probably never get worn because the length is so short and now I have to rush to find another shirt before father's day.,3
"I really liked the first two tees I bought from you but the one I was most excited about was the disappointing one!The city of Bordeaux sweatshirt was a great picture but when it arrived it looked pretty amateurish!I realize that it's difficult to print a photo on a black shirt, but this seemed like something I could have done myself with teeshirt transfer paper for dark surfaces.",3
The shirt is high quality and would buy another. Thanks!,0
So happy with the design of the t-shirts I have ordered and plain to purchase more of the great design's in the near future. There are so many to chose from and I know so many people to whom the shirts will relate to. many Christmas presents this year. thank you so much thank you to all the artiest GREAT WORK!!!!!!!,0

Love the Tee Shirt I ordered. Thank you so much for exchanging the size when needed.,0

"I thought colors of the paintings could be a little brighter.The meaning of the phrases are deep and emotional, I love it! And service was superb! Thank you!",0
We ordered a Halsey shirt for our daughter for Christmas. I was so excited about this product until I received and opened it. The screen print is so dark that you can't even tell who it is supposed to be. We were so disappointed in it that we did not even gift it to our daughter. It got thrown in the pile of old shirts to use for art projects. The actual tshirt quality was horrendous as well. It is a black tshirt and I can see right through it when I hold it up. Very disappointed!,3
"Thanks for asking for my feedback; I have to tell you that the printing quality is great; the material also great --the only thing I was not fond of -and probably very important, is the cut of the tee shirt and the finishing so I love the color and the printing but I may only wear it around the house.Thank you.Brenda Haverly, 3146802536",0

Your Customer Service team was excellent. They were very kind in notifying me that my package could not deliver due to no such address. It was missing the PO Box number I needed to include. They re-shipped it and it arrived safely. That was really nice and my Grandson loved both his sweatshirt and T-shirt. Thank you!!,0
"The shirts I ordered are great, they arrived quickly the order was correct - my only complaint which is why i gave it 4/5 and not 5 is when I was placing my order it just said ""tank top"" as an option which is fine - but there are different styles of tank tops so the shoulders on the tank tops I received were weirdly thin almost like spaghetti straps that women wear, they are thicker than that but not much more so it took a bit of getting used to.Overall good product - just disappointed by not knowing what I was getting",3
I ordered two T-shirts. They were mediocre in quality. The shirt material was thin. And while the logo looks good it has already started to peel.Thank you,0
I am completely happy with the product and especially their customer service after there was an issue with my order. It was fixed ASAP. Shop with complete confidence!,1

Shipping costs are way to expensive! I thought the parcel was shipped from america and therefore accepted the high shipping cost. But after paying it said will be shipped from europe! shipping in europe is way less expensive and therefore i can not recommend this shop at all! This is close to fraud!

Great design great shirt thank you TeePublic,0
"Seriously, this is the ONLY place I buy shirts, masks, whatever y'all sell, from anymore. Every other clothing outlet is boring and sucks big-time and this is the PERFECT way for me to express myself while also supporting up and coming small creators. I need TeePublic to look back thru my order history and give smootches to all the people I ordered from thanks! Btw, idk my order date, I've ordered so many times just take a guess",0

I was satisfied with the shirts. I also ordered as a gift for someone and they thanked me and mentioned how good of quality the shirt was that I bought for them.,0
"I purchased a mask that was a really cool logo however, the quality was so poor I feel that it may not protect me. I love to support the band but for the price and price of shipping, a quality product should have arrived. a real shame! I didn't receive the mask for weeks, and the other goods I ordered still haven't arrived. I know times are hard, but you are just taking advantage of people now.We are all on the struggle bus, disappointed!",3
"I was disappointed in the poor quality of this shirt, that I bought in a size 4T for my little grandson. As soon as I opened the package I noticed the image of the four characters was blurry and the overall print seemed dull. The material feels course, not the quality I want my grandson to wear against his skin.",3
The work and product is exceptional and working with TeePublic has been a pleasure. Have shared my experience with friends and family. Thank so much!,0
Everything came just as ordered. I love the shirts. Thanks so much!,0

"We understood and expected delays in production and delivery of the shirts given the current pandemic, but the lack of communication and length of delay was unacceptable. When the shirts finally arrived they were nice. But having to deliver a late birthday present that should have been delivered early was disappointing.",3

Now, my wife usually wears a size Medium, once in a while a Small; so, I ordered Medium. When it arrived, it fit her like a pretty SMALL ""Small"" - I could see it was uncomfortable for her. She insisted I do NOT return it, it's the thought that counts, etc., etc. But I contacted TeePublic anyway. WOW! I just received an email confirming that another shirt has been delivered in the larger size I'd requested! WHAT?! A company that sells gorgeous stuff AND cares? I'm blown away, and tell EVERYONE about this site. Thank you, Thank You, THANK YOU!!!",0

It feels like the print will crack and come off entirely after a few washes.Shipping is slow.",3

"I ordered the ""America's As*"" shirt online and when I received it, the design on the shirt was of very poor quality. It was really pixelated. I could have captured the image and made the shirt myself and saved money. I was very disappointed that they would have shipped a shirt that looked that bad after what they charged me for it.",3

Sizing is way off. Large is like a small. Very dissapointed.,3
Thank you for the perfect product,0
"It was such a joy to find the artwork of a favourite artist of mine on their site. Their unique way of showing how their various sizes of T-shirts fit by using real life pictures of male and female models, giving height and weight descriptions, truly took the guesswork out of what size to order. I like my t-shirts to drape loosely and, even after washing, it fit perfectly! The artwork on my shirt takes up a lot of surface area but they applied it in such a way that it doesn't feel like I'm wearing a plastic shield across my chest. It drapes and breathes like fabric and yet the artwork is crisp and detailed. I was so thrilled with the quality and price that I plan to buy a second shirt with the same artwork AND will look for other designs that I want.",1
Wonderful experience!! From ordering to delivery to wearing my Tees non stop since they arrived! Thank you TeePublic and Indy artists!!,0
"Amazing quality and customer service.Love the shirts!!!Needed a different size for one and they immediately sent a replacement, following up several times to make sure it was correct.Yeah, stellar work.Thank you!Will definitely be ordering again.",0
"The buying experience is good, preparation was fast, delivery is what delivery is: not depending on sender.All in all I am a bit disapointing by the quality of the tee shirt, having spent extra dollar for better quality, the thing is super hot and does not breathe much. The logo are great but if you can't wear the shirt what's the point.",3
"First, loved the design. I still have my Little People and HAD to have a shirt. Wearing it right now. Quick delivery. The quality of the shirt is great. Would order again from this company. Thank you!",0

All of our t-shirts were excellent design and qaulity...thank you!,0
"My order was handled well!! The printing on the shirt was a lighter color then the original I ordered, but nothing I would get in a twist over. I appreciate the rapid response and the customer care! Thank you!",0
"I loved the design of the shirt I purchased, even if it clearly was made up of layered clip art. I did not realize that what I would be receiving is a tee with an iron-on image. It appears as if my shirt's transfer was run through an ink jet printer that either was running low on ink or was print as such a high dpi the inks didn't meet on the transfer paper. It looks faded and somewhat pixilated, The colors are not at all vibrant (tropical Christmas design) and the transfer is sticky. I had to pull it apart out of the package. Disappointed. Will not be purchasing from here again.",3
Very happy with the quality. I'm always a little nervous when ordering online. I'm happy with what I received.,1
"Hight quality t-shirts! I ordered an man's extra large, true to size and didn't even shrink in the dryer! I also ordered a female v-neck and took the advice online to order a size larger and I agree, it fits better. The shirts are soft and the prints are quality as well. I would recommend and order from here again.",6
"I ordered a Jim Morrison shirt, and it somehow got hung up in the mail.All I did was contact TeePublic and they sent me another shirt at their expense.I usually don't experience such outstanding service from an online retailer.You can't go wrong TeePublic!They're totally awesome, and I love my shirt! Thanks, TeePublic!",0

"Hey Guys,First of all, great delivery time very fast. No complaints there.The quality of the shirt is good, however the logo is printed kinda low for my taste. It goes more across my stomach and not across my chest. Thank You",0

Absolutely love it! Was everything we expected and more... Special thanks to our artist. What a wonderful job ����,0
Awesome t shirts! Super fast shipping and great prices! Thanks to your entire team! You all rock! Happy Holidays!,0
Thanks so much for sending smaller sized shirts that look terrific! And for letting us keep the too-big ones to share with others.,0
I do like it but when I wear it for a little while I feel I'm suffocating. I really like the design on front with my word mimi. The material is nice but for me with difficult breathing it's hard to wear for a long period of time.Thank you,0
Very happy with the purchases I made!,1

"I purchased my ���������Love is not Tourism��������� pins on TeePublic because I had a difficult time finding them anywhere else. Shipping time was average. The items were packed into a small, bubble envelope so they were not damaged. However, for what the product is and how it looks, they were expensive and shipping was very high! The pins are difficult to read. They do not look like the photo because the photo online is very light. The actual product has both a dark background and dark font. It all blends together, so I���������m really disappointed! The only one that looks okay is the red pin I purchased. This one at least has a white font that stands out, even if the ",3
"The quality of the fabric was disappointing.It was very thin, almost see through and it felt stiff and scratchy.The screen print was fuzzy.Cute design, but not wearable.I am disappointed with the return policy.I guess I will just donate it and not order from TeePublic again!",3
"I purchased a cloth mask (for COVID) that was of the lower half of a characters face. It was obviously not centred. I did not contact the company, not worth it for something this cheap. Now I just flip it inside out and use the white surface. I was disappointed with the quality control.",3
My husband loved it. He has wanted one like this for over a year. Thank you keep up the good/great work.,0
"The graphics are really nice on this T-shirt but I am still very disappointed in the quality of the T-shirt itself. For the price I paid, I was expecting a thicker, higher quality material, especially when these are printed to order and considered ""custom made"" and not ""off the rack"". Additionally, because the customer pays for shipping (the price of which is inflated), I really don't feel like I got what I paid for. I will say that the turnaround time for processing my order was far quicker than one of their competitors. I'm still waiting on that order which was ordered at about the same time.",3
My order came before the date you gave. I love that and the shirt. Thank you will shop again real soon,0

"Good quality shirt. Timely shipping. Quality screen printing. My only issue was the print was much smaller than it was in the picture on the website.

Hi since you asked... sorry the shirts I ordered 2... were thin small to size and frankly a disappointment... and in addition it took over a monthto receive them after I ordered them. Two small skimpy shirts that took a wagon train to travel to me for 50 plus $ ???? Not a satisfactory order for me.,3
"I ordered a t-shirt about 4 months ago, and about 1 month ago I noticed that the graphic/logo on it is already flaking off. I think I have worn and washed it, with a pretty soft detergent, no more than 8 times since purchasing it.While the fit and feel of the shirt is great, having the logo come off so soon is disappointing :/.",3

I received two tshirts and one had a rip on the seam. Very disappointed,3
"First shirt I was sent, the printing was a bit faded and didn't quite look right. Also, the shirt was super long (even by TeePublic's sizing chart guide), so I initiated a return. The process took a little long, but I was able to swap the shirt out for a different style (same design) and they shipped it to me free of charge and the replacement looked great! I was also able to keep the original long one (which I gave to a taller friend). So, all in all, it worked out just fine. Thanks TeePublic!",0
"I received a damaged shirt and have requested help through customer service, but cannot get anyone to respond. Very disappointed.",3
I ordered 4 face masks for my 5 year old grandson. The art work was ok on the masks but they were so small they can not be used. The ear loops do not reach from one ear to the next. My grandson is average size 5 year old he wears size 6 in clothing and all of his other children's mask fit just fine. I'm very disappointed these can not be used for anything except maybe dolls.,3

The story written on the shirt is perfect for the audience.Thanks so much.,0
It was fantastic thank you I���������m glad I can suppor,0
"It was ok. One of the stickers is not as nice as the other one, in that it is just an uncut rectangle (not a big deal if the pictures and descriptions made this apparent, but same price similar design sticker, I would have thought they would both have a breakaway cutout). Also, the freight is steep, but, that isn't a feap breaker. My biggest disappointment is that the hoodie is a lot smaller than a regular cut 3x generally is. I was going for a baggy hoodie, which is why I sized up, and it fits, but it fits the same as a regular 2x pretty much. A better sizing chart would be good.",3

These were amazing and I got them in perfect time. I thank you so much!,0
Company had good communication . They contacted me everytime there was an update to be given. The estimated shipping was 10-20 days. The shirt came a couple days after the 20 day mark. I wasn���������t really concerned about shipment as I knew it would take a little while. But once I got the shirt it was definitely not worth the wait :( The colors were faded in design and the tshirt looked old and worn . I was highly disappointe,3

But most of all I enjoy finding a new artist and treating myself to some Whimsy.",1
Awesome stuff.Thanks!,0
"The mask I ordered was way big. Ear loops were too long and shipping seemed to take longer than normal. But on the plus side, customer service said they would ship a new, smaller one asap and to keep or donate original mask. I was ready for a battle in getting a replacement or refund but was pleasantly suprised. Thank you TeePublic.",0
Product came pretty fast. Ordered a couple days before Christmas and it came within a week or 2. Best thing about this website is how I could find any type of shirt I'm looking for! Regular T-shirts are a brand called Bella Canvas. Thanks for the great product!,0
I am disappointed to be honest and I was looking forward to receiving these. The term sheet fits poorly - i ordered a large because that is my size. The size i received is snug and i clearly need the next size over. Also the quality is thin.,3

The print on my shirt is also cracking. It should not be cracking, especially if it hasn't been washed. I reached out to the company a week ago about sizing and have yet to get a response. I will never order again from this company. Very disappointing!",3
"The T-shirts arrived timely and as photographed, the only problem one shirt was too small.I reached out in an email, explained the situation,and requested the next larger size.I immediately heard back from Customer Service.A new one is being sent at no additional cost.WOW, I'm impressed!!!!That is what I call Premier Service!THANK YOU.I will definitely be ordering fromTeePublic in the future.",0

Received a shirt that was too small for Christmas. Attempted to order the right size but evidently ordered the wrong type fit so it was also too small. I give up!,3
I love the tshirts . I realize they came from two different vendors but I ordered the same size. It was Mens 3x and they are so different. The cut of the sleeves and the length. Love both fabrics and the pics! Thanks!,0
"This is the 5th time I have ordered from TeePublic.The orders are correct, fast & of good quality.",6
"Communication fab, dispatch and delivery very prompt and good quality clothing. Very happy with my purchase x",1
I do like your shirts with saying on them But I was wondering if you could print a custom saying if I wanted it .I am hoping someone in your company could EMAIL ME. Hope to be hearing from youTHANKS,0
Didn���������t like the coat at all . W,4
I ordered pins and a tee shirt. I got exactly what wanted and ordered. I paid for faster delivery and got it in four days which was exactly what I needed. Thank you for filling my order and getting it to me promptly.,0
Thank you for the fast turnaround time for the custom Hamilton Lafayette T-shirt. Good quality fabric and artwork.,0
"I've ordered from TeePublic a few times and my orders have always been correct, my shirts perfect, delivered on time, and at a good price. Zero complaints.",6
"The products I received were fine and as expected. The trouble lies in the shipping. I placed an order a month before Christmas with ""Guaranteed by Christmas"" shipping. I know- once an item is shipped its in the hands of the delivery services, but hear me out- The items were shipped via Mail Innovations, which, if you are not familiar, is NOT a guaranteed service in any way- Mail Innovations tells companies that use their service this openly and makes it a very poor choice for a company to use for Guaranteed by any date delivery. One item arrived on time, the other got lost in Ohio for 3 weeks. When I contacted TeePublic days before Christmas,they agreed to reship the item that was lost in transit but would not guarantee Christmas delivery which was a huge disappointment since that was the purpose of the purchase in the first place. So, 3 stars for the product, but the fulfillment left a lot to be desired.",3
"Ordering, delivery and t-shirt were all excellent. Thanks",0
Shirts run WAY small once washed. Really disappointed I spent so much for shirts that don���������t fit my son.,3
"Delivered quickly, items as ordered...thanks",0
This company is very reliable and has very excellent customer service.They are very fast at getting orders ready and shipped out. Thank you.,0
"I like the shirt I ordered and received. I ordered an XL and it's probably a little larger than I'd like, but I ordered that size so no big deal. However, I was disappointed with the shipping. My item shipped on April 26th, but I didn't receive it until May 10th. I clicked on the tracking info, but even though it said shipped with UPS, it's through the USPS, so you can't track it. So, even though I paid $7 for shipping, the method used was as slow as can be bought.",3
TShirt arrived. Ordered an XL (womens)..... fits like a medium. Graphic on the t-shirt was fairly cheap looking. Quite disappointed.,3
"Very happy. Easy to order, timing was as expected. T���������s ",1
Super awesome fantastic wow thank you so much,0
I didn't get the correct colored tee shirts I ordered and have not heard back from customer service. Super disappointing because I want to support small businesses!,3
"The print was blown out and awful. Quality of T-shirt is garbage. A 2XL is not ever tight on me, so that didn���������t seem right either. Very disappointed. And I can���������t get a refund ",3
I am happy with the shirt I ordered for my grandson for Christmas.I'm sure he will love wearing it as he plays his new Fallout 76 game.Shipping was as promised and prompt and the shirt appears to be quality.Thank you.,0

The quality is good. & so as the print. Love the shirt. Thanks guys. Great job!,0
Just what I expected. Delivery came in reasonable time frame.But I suggest to delivery person to put package closer to door not in plain site from street view.Too much gets stolen as it is.Thank you,0
I bought a printed t-shirt. It took 12 days to receive via postal service. Was disappointed in that because my confirmation said it would be 6-8 days. Probably not TeePublics fault knowing how slow the post office can be.The fabric for the shirt I thought to be a thin knit cotton & not a good quality based on many other t-shirts I have.The print on the shirt was fine & was as I ordered.,3
Shirt looks great & arrived a day early!! My husband loves it too. Thank you...I���������ll definitely be ordering from you all ,0
"I bought 3 long sleeve shirts for my little brother for Christmas. He has special needs and HAS to have long sleeves. It is so hard to find nice long sleeve t-shirts and I was able to get him his favorite designs at a very affordable price. Everyone was so impressed and happy with them, we will definitely be buying him more in the future. Thank you!",0
"Perfect shirt, fabric is soft & was washed with cold water dried on low setting, no fading. I ordered a size larger than I normally wear & am pleased with the fit & quantity. I will enjoy wearing it to promote the Arrtists!",1
My family and I loved ours T-shirt Thanks. Maria,0
Super disappointed in the masks I received. The ones I actually received were a different style than what was pictured at time of purchase. The designs are basically pointless because you can���������t tell what they are. Trying to return but no respo,3
I give a 5 star rating. So many designs to choose from and everything I saw I liked. Purchased t-shirts and hoodie as Christmas gifts taking advantage of the holiday discounted prices. The items were shipped quickly and I received them just in time for Christmas. Thank you and I will probably be making more purchases in the future.,0
Smooth transaction. Great art. thanks!,0

I ordered a t-shirt in XL and it was huge. They replaced it with a Large. Thank you!,0
"Exactly what I ordered! Very happy, thank you!",0
"Reasonable shipping time considering it is the holidays! My only disappointment was the wall hanging of Manos: Hands of Fate. I had the impression it was made of heavier fabric. That said, I will suggest that the recipient of the gift color it in. :)Great place for people to sell their tshirts, etc.!",3
The tee shirts are well made & exactly as described. I followed the suggested size chart & it was accurate.,6
The description was accurate and the order was shipped fast.,6
Ordering was easy and simple.My order was received within days with no problems.The quality of the merchandise was a little disappointing.The t-shirts were very thin and the printing was too light to cover the color of the shirt.,3
The site was super simple to navigate. Items are amazing quality. Everything about the experience was perfect. Thank you.,0
"Communication from when I ordered to when I received my shirt was excellent. My disappointment was that I ordered a large shirt and even though the tag said large, it was not. The shirt is a medium at best.",3

"Overall I am pleased with the quality of the tee shirts I ordered.Also, happy with the updates on the progress and shipping of my order.However, disappointed that two identical sizes and companies fit differently, one perfectly and one a tad too small. Also, I ordered two tees and one of the designs is exactly as pictured in the website. The other is a little disappointing and not as vibrant as shown. It happens to also be the one without the perfect fit:(",3
Everything looks Great. It all came in as ordered and arrived Quickly.I look forward to buying more in the future. I bought 9 shirts on my first order.Thanks,0

"Shirts are always high quality and true to size! Shipping was faster than expected, even in the holidays! Thanks, TeePublic!",0
"The tshirts are cute andgood quality. The order was delivered earlier than expected. My only complaint is I clicked on the shirt showing it was on sale for 15.00 but when I made the order of 19 shirts, the price was 22.00. I did find a discount code for 15% off which helped. I had to order 2 more shirts which I did get them for the 15.00. Just little frustrated that I couldn���������t get the 15.00 sale price the first time. The shirts are for a Senior citizens Line dance Christmas show. Thank you for t",0

"I was quite disappointed to find that the design was smaller than pictured, and the printing job was done quite poorly. The yellow ink around ""bun"" is inconsistently colored, with some parts appearing darker and almost orange, and others a dilute mustard color. The sweater itself also had frayed and loose threads sticking out all over. For the price, I am extremely disappointed in the quality I received.",3

One of the shirts I ordered was the wrong color.Both shirts have damage on the logos and don't look right. They are so stiff and uncomfortable I cannot wear them even after washing.

"I received the poorest quality, poorly made, and downright cheap hoodie. The print on the hoodie is difficult to see in places. I'm so disappointed that for $45.00, I got a thin, poorly made hoodie. The picture on the website looks nothing like what I received. Buyer beware, I guess.UPDATE: I was refunded my entire purchase price. I changed my rating to two stars. They should have never sent me the hoodie to begin with due to poor quality, but I appreciate their quick response to the issue.",3
Highest recommendation--shirts were so very well made-- Will definitely shop with you again--thank you,0
Exactly as described and timely! The only graphic t's i buy are from Tee Public!,6
"I got the Trucker Convoy womens vneck tshirt. Love it, but the colors of the transfer are quite faded, like it had already been washed 50X. That's a bit disappointing, but overall the shirt and fit is good.",3
"Great looking cups, very good work, love it, thanks,",0

"I recieved 2 grace jones tshirts today, I love them thanks!",0
"The designs are great, those I have no issue with. The main issue that I had was related to shipping (it took over a month for me to receive my items). Of course, now that I've received the items, I have a new issue. I ordered two tshirts that were described as 'XXL' - the largest size in that was available in that style. These shirts are NOT extra large anything. I'd be surprised if they were larges. They certainly will not fit me, nor the person for whom they were meant to be a gift. I am very disappointed.",3
The shirt ordered printed very poorly. Disappointed with the quality as it was out of register and tee shirt showed though the print. Contacted Customer Service who quickly and kindly refunded my purchase though I still payed a large delivery charge to Canada not refunded.,3
"While the tees themselves are comfy, that is the only reason for 2 stars over 1. The quality and especially coloring of the printed designs that these artists put so much work into is terrible. Images frequently have spots or sections that appear blurred or stretched. I ordered a shirt from one creator that was supposed to be only line art in a beautiful almost electric blue. What I received was a white with an ever-so-slight blue tinge to it. When I tried TeePublic for my own brand, I found major inconsistencies in colors from shirt to shirt, despite being the same print file for both. I also noted everything looked like it had a grey wash over it, dulling all my colors and making some items unreadable. This, of course, is never shown on the mocks of the merch and instead only appears once your merch makes it into your customers hands. Very disappointing and decided to find a much better quality vendor for all my branding needs.",3
I placed an order for a small child's sweatshirt for my granddaughter's birthday on Sept 21.It was difficult to use the size chart listed but I figured out that I needed a small. I ordered and received an adult small.I reached out to the company to get an exchange and the response and customer service has been poor. I'm very disappointed and will not order again,3
These shirts are AWESOME!!!!I am a new customer and I am a Facebook friend of one of the independent artists.Since I am now ordering shirts from Teepublic I will never again go to a store like DXL or Wal-Mart for any shirt ever again.Teepublic is cheaper and has better quality shirts.Thank you Teepublic.,0

"Only two complaints about my experience. First, I paid to have a prio shipping but the date wasn���������t respected for some reason. I didn���������t receive my gifts on time for Christmas which is a bit unfortunate. Second, the size of the t-shirt is really tight for a large one and the measures weren���������t on the website as far as I know. Adding those could be helpful.

"My husband's favorite tshirt got ruined a few months ago. I have been looking for another to replace it and was having no luck. I came across TeePublic and thought I'd give it a try. I couldn't believe it when I found a very similar one! I ordered it and it came in a very timely manner. When he got it he was thrilled! He said it was even better than the original! Thank you so much for your artists and such a vast variety! My husband doesn't ask for much, so giving him this was so satisfying. I will definitely buy from TeePublic again!",0
Love it thank you soo much,0
"I received the shirts. One of them had an orange stain that will not come out from the fabric when washed. For a product to be compromised with basic quality issues like this, was a disappointment. Also, the inscription on one of the shirts is incorrect. You have quality issues. Again this is doubly disappointing. I paid $50 for these products. I am not satisfied and will not purchase again from your business.",3
My Grandson was very pleased with the shirt I had picked for him.I was disappointed in the delivery service.,3
Originally I had posted a complaint. T public got back with me right away and made it right. The print was too small and they shipped me a new shirt expedited exactly how I wanted it. Thank you guys for making it right. Great customer service.,0

I was very disappointed in the ladies size 2x. It looked on the model like it should be bigger.I wear a ladies large and a 2x in ladies was more like a ladies large. I guess the ladies tee shirts are more sized for teenagers.,3

Well I ordered a men's size medium and it came very long and slender like a kids extra long shirt and since it was to small I wanted to exchange for a large it's impossible this is the hardest site to communicate with after paying almost 40$ on 2 t shirts it shouldn't be so hard to get the correct size I need. It's very disappointing.,3

"I was looking for an item and was just 'Googling"" it, I cam e across this site that had the item I was looking for and was offering a very good sale so I took a chance and bought it and I was extremely happy. Th item actually arrived 4 day early which in my book sets them apart from the heard, if I have to made one critique it is that the item I ordered I was a Large but it fits like a very loose Large or possible a tight X-Large, I'm hoping it will shrink a bit when I wash it.",1
I ordered a t-shirt and stickers. The stickers came really quickly but the t-shirt took a good bit longer.I'm very happy with both.,1

"I was pretty disappointed with the quality of printing on the shirts I received. The graphics look so great on the website, but when you get the actual shirts, the images look low-resolution and cheap. The printing is very thin, so the colors are muddy and you see the color of the T-shirt fabric bleeding through the graphics. The words don���������t appear well-defined, and actually look blurry. What you see on the website looks nothing like what you get on the shirts. I bought 5 shirts, and they���������re all crappy-looking compared to what I thought I was buying. The only redeeming aspect of this service was that the ���������",3

My only suggestion is please use a different shipping carrier or at give more options. FedEx has become less reliable than the USPS and that's saying a lot lol. Thank you Teepublic for always making my gifts to others amazing and becoming some of my fav pieces of clothing. :),0

Crooked logo art! I waited a month for my $30+ dollar t-shirt to be delivered and when it finally came in the mail the logo i picked out was laid out crooked.

"So updated this review. Very happy that Tee Public is kindly sending me a replacement for the George Reeves B/W Superman Symbol T-shirt at no cost to me.That's really...um...Super!They have an easy ""photo upload"" that I used to illustrate the flaw on the design. Very handy.It was disappointing that it wasn't gotten right the first time, but I'm looking forward to the second try. Thumbs up!My not so great original review is below:*****Fairly disappointed in the George Reeves Superman Symbol (black and white) I received today. Firstly, it's lavender to purple. I was hoping for a black or grey.Secondly, there appears to be a flaw, which looks like a blue ink pen mark across the Symbol image on the lower left.Not happy at all.The other T, a Toshiro Mifune Sanjuro image, is pretty all right. No complaints there.",3

I have ordered several items from TeePublic and have been very happy with the products I've received.

"I ordered a hoodie from TeePublic and, although upon prompt delivery, I needed to make an exchange. The process was SUPER easy. Diana and Georgiana were pleasant, courteous, and not only fixed the problem but did so in an extremely timely manner. Thanks TeePublic! Highly recommended.",0

Man I'm a big wrx sti fan. I currently own a 2001 legacy gtb e tune/rev d right hand drive vehicle. It's a third Gen wagon and since yall didn't have one in design I got your 2nd Gen wagon instead. It was so well designed to the colour and the comfort I had to leave a 5 star review. Thank you and thank you to the artist that made my sweater wish I knew the artists name so I could them again!,0
Was very disappointed in the lettering of the T-shirt. Reminded me of when you are running out of ink on your printer. Thought it could have been bolder,3

My nephew really wanted a t shirt with this Roblox logo. He googled it and found your site. I was dubious about ordering but glad I did. It is perfect. I also liked the pictures that showed how the different sizes fit. It helped me to order the right size. Thanks.,0
"I've been ordering t-shirts for many years at Moteefe, Shirtcity, Speadshirt etc. Read a few bad reviews, but decided to give TeePublic a chance because of the designs.First off, pricing is excl. vat, which is very uncommon for private sales (vs b2b were it is always done), making the final total sum a very disappointing. This lead me to wait ordering. When i looked at my shopping cart the next day, suddenly prices had lowered about ���������6 per shirt (excl. vat) and brought the price to the competitors level.The order was made on and shipping was fast (3 business days).Upon receiving i noticed the bag was a little small to hold 5 t-shirts my size (XL). Opening confirmed that the t-shirts are rather thin and are see through. I ordered the tri-blend so may others types may be thicker, but not what i was expecting and seriously doubting whether they will hold up over time. Same goes for the print. Not the worse i have seen, but i can't shake the feeling the some was tr""ink"". Future will tell, but for now... i don't feel like i bought a good product, maybe even feel a little cheated. For the moment, i will buy my t-shirts elsewhere until these from TeePublic have proven their worth.",3
"Great tee, fast delivery, all great! Thanks!",0
"Excellent, exactly what I saw was what showed up thanks.",0

My order has been 'printing' for a week...starting to lose confidence I will actually get what I ordered.Update 11/12 - Order is not arriving today. I finally received confirmation from UPS that the package will arrive...11/17. Super bummed.,3
As of this date 12/30 I have not received my order and I am very disapointed as it was a Christmas gift.,3
Products shipped quickly and arrived promptly but the quality of the fabric is mediocre for the price and the images were not as vibrant as depicted online. The overall effect is cheap. I do not recommend.,4

"I ordered 4 items. One shirt came quickly, the other 3 took a rather long time with the shipping info not being completely accurate. The shirt I ordered was nice. The 3 hoodies I ordered do not have the best screen print quality at all. The 2 kids ones are pretty bad so I'm definitely disappointed as these were Christmas presents and it's too late to have them fixed. The other hoodie is for me which is a little bit better screen print quality but I imagine after a couple washes it'll start coming off.",3
"The shirts I ordered are kids size. I ordered large, are they large for children? I want to sent my order back. Very disappointed and the fact they were gifts. Dealing with the hassle of returning them and refunded or exchange is a headache.",3

"The quality of the T-shirt is terrible. The 2XL African print T-shirtI ordered for my husband came faded. He obviously can't wear that!. I would have given it a 1star but the African print is amazing. It was a big waste of money for that price. I paid over 40cd for that particular T-shirt. I bought four T-shirts: two for my kids, my husband and me. I had great expectations after reading some of the reviews. I paid the original price for it which is over 30cd for adult sizes. I paid an additional shipping cost and an extra 15cd for costumes.Just imagine the amount spent and then receiving a faded blackT-shirt, nicely packaged sent from the US to Canada. I am so disappointed, to say the least! would I want a repeat of that experience ? Obviously NO!",3

Shirt was way too small for size and quality wasnt very good either,4
"$38 for a tshirt that is see-through??? Absolutely ridiculous. Had I know the quality and fit of this shirt, I would have never purchased it. The graphic on the shirt is so simple, nothing could possibly justify the price point. So disappointed.",3

Perfect. Actually receved the package a couple of days before promised.Thanks.,0
Graphic on coffee cup is so dark you can hardly see it against the background. Very disappointed.,3

I am more than satisfied with my Peterbilt sweatshirt. The quality is excellent and the print of the truck is outstanding. If I may make a suggestion. I would like to see such a sweatshirt with a print of a Peterbilt cabover. These trucks are classics and deserved to be remembered. Thank you.,0

"I ordered an adult ladies XL t-shirt with the saying ""It's my birthday"".when I received it, it was a youth XL.I was so disappointed because it was a present for a friend.Too late to get another one, plus policy states I can't return.I am so disappointed",3
Im dissapointed as it took 3 weeks to get the replacement shirt I ordered as the first one didn't fit and due to this I couldn't wear it for what it was intended for because the it was too late.Just don't know why it took so long to get the second shirt when it was advertised for weeks leading up to Christmas that if shirts were ordered by a certain date it was guaranteed to be delivered by xmass. I had re ordered weeks before deadline and still only received my replacement shirt after xmass. The original shirt got here super quick but it seems like the replacement took almost 3 weeks.,3
The Prints were Amazing & very colorful thank you so much ! Although the Tees did run a little small but fit ok. Other than that the item was exactly as ordered ! Great job guys !!,0
Order was exactly correct and just what we had been looking for!,6

Very happy w/my tshirt. The size chart is definitely a must. I usually wear a lg & got a xxl. & its probably closer to a med.,1
The size I ordered was too small. You guys sent me a better size no questions asked. Thank you.,0
I wanted 2 shirts but I did something wrong. I did 2 separate orders. I contacted you about combining the orders. You removed one shipping charge and combined the order. That was very kind thank you so much!!,0

I bought a shirt as a gift and it showed up as described. Had a strong vinegar smell to it though? But overall was happy with my purchase. Thank you.,0

Very happy with the service and quality of the product,1
"I love the quality of the products and all the amazing designs that artists have created. However, as a customer outside of the US I found it difficult to navigate how much the order and the shipping would cost. My order cost a lot more than I had anticipated, which will probably hinder me from ordering from TeePublic in the future. It would have been helpful to have an option to select that I was an international or Canadian shopper, to be notified in advance that shipping would cost extra, and/or to be able to view the prices in my own currency.Thank you though! I love the wide range of designs and products.",0
Arrived earlier than expected.Very happy!,1
i respect the understanding. you guys are great at what you do. thank you very much.,0
"Easyto browse site, good selection, fast shipping, thanks.",0
"Could not find information on t-shirt material composition when I ordered.I selected the ""premium"" t-shirt thinking it would be higher quality, but was disappointed to find the material was thin and was a 60/40 cotton/poly blend.Would have been nice to have a thicker, 100% cotton option.Selected this design because of the group association.I could not find the title of the shirt or the name of the artist when I went to the general site's URL and used the search feature; I had to use a specific link/QR code that the artist provided.Thought shipping costs were somewhat high.",3
"I'm very pleased with the gaminghoodies I ordered for my grandson.He loved them both.I am also happy with how quick I received them.Even though it was the Christmas time, they arrived much quicker than I expected.I'll be ordering again soon.",1

Excellent shirt and mug! Thanks!,0
Design is crooked.I'm disappointed considering the cost.I would have been happy to wait an extra day for delivery for the design to be properly aligned.,3
"I placed an order and somehow didn't order 2 of an item I wanted, the order had already shipped and I couldn't find the item again on the website.I emailed on Thanksgiving Day thinking it could be DAYS before I heard from someone.Amalea responded to my email Friday morning and was a great help getting the remaining item of my order on it's way in time for our upcoming trip.The shirts are good quality and the design is exactly what we wanted.Thank you.",0

"I want to highlight how easy is to buy, and how good they work with the delivery time. Thanks.",0
Great product.Arrived in timely manner.Thanks.,0
"Unfortunately I was very disappointed with what I received. I looked at many websites that offered similar products, but the reviews I read made me feel confident I would be pleased with the gifts I was purchasing for my friends for Christmas. Price wasn���������t as much of a concern as the quality I was looking for. I have not tried to contact the company yet to see what they are willing to do about it, but my issue is the actual print on the sweatshirts I purchased. They look as if the ���������stamp��������� they used had ran out of ink. They look as if they have already been worn several times. The sweatshirts themselves are fine, it is the print I am upset about, unfortunately. Again, I have not contacted the company to rectify the situation, so I have no feedback regarding customer service",3
My tee shirts were beautiful and sizing I'd your to git.I'm happy,1
Perfect fit. Well made and lightweight. Plan to order more. Thanks,0
"The products are quality, colourful and are like what is advertised on the site. Thank you",0
Unfortunately 2 of the shirts are not correct and are not usable. The colors of the print are completely wrong. One shirt has spots/ink stains on the back and side. The shirts also were very late to arrive.,4
I have ordered before and had A great experience.This has been a bit of a disappointment.I ordered youth Lg for both a long sleeve tee and hoodie. They are vastly different in sizes. One will have to be returned after Xmas.I followed the size chart listed on the website and they are way off. The other thing is that 2 of the hoodies look extremely cheap screen printed quality that look like they will come off after a few washes.,3
"Honestly? I don���������t like it at all! It took to long to get here and someone put a slit in it, I���������ll ",4
I Happy I have few things in Cart leave there My VA check will be in my checking around First of Month. Thank you madam,0
Just what I wanted. It was a gift so I'm glad it fits and and it is visually clear. It is really appreciated. If I had to make any suggestions I would say that the picture could be put up more on the shirt as the top part of the shirt feels empty (not that it matters just being nitpicky). But seriously thank you,0
Took 2 weeks to ship and was charged $6 to wait that long. The screenprint is fuzzy. The shirt is scratchy. Very disappointing.,3
T-shirt fits perfectly and others loved it. Thank you!,0
I am so disappointed the T-shirt I ordered came quickly but I ordered large and it's more like small your product runs very small I am unable to give the T-shirt to the person I purchased it for because it's too too small and I am very disappointed I did not order a small shirt I ordered a large,3
"Navigation of the site is easy, the shipping updates are great, just generally enjoy buying from TeePublic :)",1
Got the shirt and it was perfect. It fit perfectly and got it early. Thank you,0
"Hello, I found it very easy to find my obscure bear shirt and delivery was spot on. Thank you. Steve stephens.",0
I was very pleased with how quickly he responded to my message regarding the in accuracy of the image on my Jerry Garcia tie dye hand T-shirt. I was offered a new one to replace it and it arrived so quickly exactly the way I ordered it. I would definitely work with you guys again. Thanks for your time and efforts,0
"I got the shirt in a very timely manner, but held off reviewing until I washed the tee shirt.Even though I got the men's large, assuming it might shrink a bit, unfortunately, it shrunk considerably when it was laundered.And although I used softener, it's still badly wrinkled.So, my opinion is:even though the cost was not cheap, the tee shirt is cheap and of poor quality (especially for $20!).Other than the wonderful graphic, I think this shirt is worth about $5.00.Very disappointed!I planned on wearing this shirt a lot, but it just looks too cheap to wear places...",3
I was very pleased with the product and the speed of delivery. Thanks so much.,0
"No issues with TeePublic were experienced, however the post office had issues getting our package delivered. The folks at TeePublic were quick to jump in and help us out. Many Thanks TeePublic folks.",0

Excellent Job on the shirt my Daughter and son in law are going to love them. Thank you so.much!! Happy holidays,0
The designs never look like they do on the site. 3 times in a row we've ordered shirts where the graphics are faded and the sizing isn't right. I'm extremely disappointed in TeePublic and won't be buying anything else from them.,3
My daughter LOVES her sweatshirt! Thank you!,0
The product was terrible! This shirt was wrinkled and the design was completely worn off. I previously contacted you to express my disappointment. I got no reply. I'm very dissatisfied with this company and the purchase.,3
Quality is great.Artistry is the best.Thank you.,0
The only thing that I was a bit disappointed in was how long it took to get the tees.,3

Expedited shipping (that I paid for due to Christmas) was on time. Products were t-shirts and they were delivered as promised and in good condition. Thank you!,0
"I am disappointed in my product. It doesn't look like the picture advertised and the t shirt is small, to be a large. I ordered it for someone's birthday and paid to have it rushed but just wasted $30 and had to just spend that much more to order another shirt.",3
"I ordered one tote bag and one face mask to support the ���������Meat is Immoral���������.com campaign and I have to say I am extremely disappointed in the quality of both products. The price was way to high for what���������s being put out. First of all the tote bag is made with clear plastic thread that looks so cheap and not at all durable. Second the face mask is so ridiculously huge, great for a man with a beard but not an average sized woman, it should be available in sizes. Also the logo on it is poor quality, blurry almost, and printed on a pleats! You can���������t even see what is says while it���������s on your face! Honestly I wouldn���������t have even bought it had it been availab",3

TeePublic is a GREAT company with EXCEPTIONAL customer service. They never cease to amaze me with the effort they take to make sure I'm completely satisfied with with my purchases. Thank you from a of long term customers.,0
"The two t-shirts I ordered for my great-grandsons arrived while we were on vacation so we just picked them up yesterday to see them for ourselves.They're very cute, however, the 3T looks like a size 2T (measured against four other 3T's) and the 2T is very, very small. It looks like an 18 month size compared to other 18 month shirts.In addition 100% cotton so we have to allow for shrinkage when laundered.We'rehighly disappointed since our little guys love bugs and the artwork on the shirts is so cute.HOWEVER, we'll have to use the 3T for our 2T-size great-grandson, and send back the 2T one.Perhaps someone in your company used the wrong sizing chart on these.",3
Love everything I bought!Thanks!,0
Am very pleased with the quality of the tote and shirts--especially the shirts--they are very soft--will be ordering again--thanks,0
Fantastic service! Thank you,0
Shirts were made with good quality material My spouse and son both enjoyed their shirts!,1
I ordered a black shirt. Looks dingy and smaller than normal,7
"Honestly, the website wasn't the greatest. I kept getting pop-up offers to save money if I signed up for texts and emails, but no promo code was ever given. I did email customer service about that, and they gave me one to use, so I won't knock them too hard. The sizing function on the website is ridiculous. Actual measurements would be a lot more helpful. The shipping took a little longer than expected, also.",7
The shirts I ordered were exactly as advertised. The sizing was accurate and they even had models for the different sizes which was very helpful. I will likely order from TeePublic again in the future.,7
I got a T-shirt that had a marking on the underarm and they sent a new fixed one right away for free :) ty,7

Ordered according to size chart and it was a perfect fit! Great quality tee,7
I ordered a large and got a large child's size t shirt.,7
Was easy to order and I received it quickly..it was just what I ordered,7
Good updates on the order and fast shipping. They offered to provide a replacement t-shirt as the one I received had a squint print.,7
"Fast delivery, so happy with the art on the T-shirt, i ordered a size up like was suggested, item still runs very small, but my daughter loved it, it was for her Birthday ����",7
I submitted a request for a fix on my order as the print was on the back of the zip hoodie. Not on the chest where it should be and have not heard anything,7
Great turn around on my order! Designs were more beautiful in real time than virtual depiction. Advice to order up a size was wise.,7
HORRIBLE MISLEADINGAND INCOMPETENTNEVER AGAIN,7
"I received my replacement hoodie!It is a little big, but absolutely love it.Nikki Clark",7
I gave this one star because I had to I would have given it and -10 Stars I had a problem ordering online so I emailed them for help they stated they did they made the wrong product and telling me I can't get a credit back or they can't fix it now for something I never ordered they are non helpful and have no contact number to call them I would not order anything from these people ever not even for a pet rock don't order from these people they're horrible,7

Excellent and diverse selection for every taste imaginable. Fast and prompt delivery. And it is nice to know you are supporting independent artists.,7
Excellent value and speedy delivery. Looks exactly like the picture.,7
Shirts were great quality and art was even better.,7
"My shirt arrived today.Love design and color, however it is small to be sized XL.",7
"I ordered and orange and a blue t-shirt with black print.The orange with black was perfect.The blue with the black was less than wonderful, and when washed there was an inconsistent white ""ghosting"" outlining the black.Best to try out the blue on black in house and rethink it.Perhaps keep the blue, but change the imagine to white.",7
I bought 14 human centipede shirts for the guys in the shop. the print is clear and the fabric is very high quality they were all pleased,7
Quality shirt exactly as described I would gladly buy from again,7
Awesome shirt. Thank you. Great quality,7
Cant you see how many stars I gave?,7
I was sent an email that my items were delivered to my home.....but the items were not delivered to me. I sent an email which still has not received a response. Bad business! I want my money back,7

"While the design and color of each of the two t shirts I ordered was very nice, the quality of the t shirts themselves was very poor.One shirt had an incorrectly sewn seam with an open hole and the other after the first washing developed small holes in the fabric.I am very disappointed, not in the artwork, but in the fabric and construction of the shirts.I noticed they were made in Nicaragua which is very distressing to me.I have personally seen Nicaraguan Zona Franca (CAFTA ""free trade"") factory complexes in which this type of clothing is made and they are set up for worker abuse without protections of workers' rights.It is distressing that your support of independent artists includes clothing made under such conditions in a country that clearly violates human rights.",7
"Tees were decent quality, reasonably priced,and arrived quickly. Only problem was that the website showed the picture on the back of the tees, and when they came, they all had the photo on the front.",7
"Great shirt, will definitely order again",7
"The shirt is totally awesome! It came a few days late, no fault of Tee Public, but they let me know via email. I'm very happy with the 'Spiritual Gangster' shirt I got, it's perfect. So was Tee Public",7
I reached out a few days again about a defective product and have yet to hear back.,7
"Got my order wrong. This was done before Christmas, with plenty of time and I still got my gift ruined. Only bright side I guess is the quick turnaround on getting my corrected order, but we as a consumer should trust that if we order something online, then it should be fulfilled accordingly. Everything is digital now, no excuse for something being ""written wrong"". I do appreciate that this issue was resolved, unfortunately I will no longer shop here. I'm sure one person doesn't matter to you guys, but its just left a negative impression on me. Good luck to you all. Happy holidays",7
Decent quality and quick delivery. Will use again,7
I was happy with the shirt and the sticker. But the sweatshirt was far to small for an xl and the print was faded and hard to read.,7
Fast shipping and the t-shirt was true to size and gnarly,7
I was terribly disappointed with my last TeePublic purchases. This is the reason why I have always been hesitant to buy from them since my first bad experience in 2016. I bought two t shirts from the same seller on Black Friday for a friend's birthday which was this month. I just opened them today and noticed the graphic is noticeably skewed to the left. I tried the shirt on and it's even worse when worn. I buy a lot of t shirts each month from different stores on line and this is my biggest pet peeve. I never end up wearing shirts that have the designs not properly centered and end up throwing them out and wasting the money. It's even worse this time because these were supposed to be a gift for a friend.,7
The t shirt I brought last week is a good and reasonable buy and it's a good value as well.,7
It took 3 weeks to get to me which normally wouldn���������t be a huge deal but since it was Christmas themed I only had o,7
"Love their shirts, prompt delivery Jeff",7
A lot of great designs.Shirts run small. Great gifts.,7
"I will never order from another t-shirt company. Tee Public rulz!!!! Best selection, best customer service, best everything!!!!!!",7

"I love teepublic. I use them for personal and gift giving and am always satisfied with the quality, price, and service.",7
"I ordered the Abominable Snowflakes shirt. Heather grey.I love it!I ordered a men's medium (as my shoulders are wider than most women's shirts).I'm 5'6"" and 168 lbs.It fits perfectly!",7

"I was happy with the resolution of exchanging my shirts. I was nervous I wouldn���������t get the sizes needed in time, but they arrived earlier",7
Sizing seems to run small. Material too light? Graphics Good.,7
My sweater arrived on time and it was exactly as the picture described!!,7
The only place I go for T-shirts! Quality is always top notch and the variety of awesome designs is unmatched.,7
Got my shirt rather quickly and totally love my shirt,7
Absolutely love that I can support independent artists! I loved that I could find really unique art! Even better when it's on sale. Shirt quality and print quality are pretty great too. The only thing thats bothering me a little is the tracking process. I get the email that says package shipped. But after even 4 days I still don't receive tracking info. I know that's probably more on UPS's part. But if that part were repaired then this would be a more easy-feel experience ^-^ But their customer service reps are AMAZING. They always help to make things right.,7
Simple process. Great variety of geekdom designs. Nice quality shirts! Great stocking stuffers. Will shop again.,7
"My grand daughter orders a lot of tee shirts from TeePublic and they always arrive quickly and are great quality and true to size. My last order did not arrive on time (which turned our to be the fault of the post office). I contacted TeePublic first and got an immediate online response and they were ready to resend the order right away. The shirts did arrive the next day due to a postal delay and I let them know it was not their error but the Post Office. However, it was great to know if there are problems with an order, TeePublic is ready to make it right. My grand daughter will continue to order as usual. We love the quality of their products and customer service.",7

An excellent job was done in interpreting the artwork that I sent. Happy enough to reorder.,7
"It was very low quality, very grainy looking. It honestly looks like crap. I know middle schoolers who could do a better job in MS Paint. You can't return or get refunds which is ridiculous. Especially if it looks like crap. It was not worth the money.",7

Awesome tees. Love em!,7
The two shirts I ordered turned out great. I understand shipping is messed up inregards to covid but wow it took a long time to ship. I just don't see why it took that long lol. Other than that no problems. I was gonna order some more shirts but its not really worth it at the moment.,7
"Took advantage of the $13 sale.Bought 15 shirts.When it goes on sale again, i'll get more!!Need thundercats group photos, gijoe team, x-men animated series team, superfriends...autobot and decepticon teams too!!",7

Great quality shirt with artwork I love.Glad to help support independent artists.,7
Loved the shirts. The design was spot on!,7
Great customer service and almost too much to choose from!My only wish is the search to be a little more accurate and possible categorize all your great selection!,7
"This is the first time I ever wrote a bad review. It'snot so much about the service but about the product itself. For the price I paid the quality is horrible. First of all shirt is paper thin and see thru. But most important is the writing on the shirt. The ink is so light it looks like I washed it 20 times! I purposely bought a lighter color shirt so it would stand out more but instead the writing was lighter. You can't even see the words ""it's ok"" in the background.If print was black and not light gray it would probably stand out more. Plus it's cut small. I should have got a size 3X. I hate to say it but I could have went to the $5 store up the block and got the same or better quality. It shouldn't have been more than $10 and that's including shipping! I wish I could return it for a bigger size and different color but it ain't worth the hassle. I really love the saying. If she was still alive she would not like this at all. RIP NIGHTE BIRD YOU ARE DEARLY MISSED",7
"We ordered several custom- printed shirts. When they arrived, one was too small. We contacted them, and were sent a replacement at no charge without having to return the other one. Really great customer service.",7

I've been waiting for this author to sell more items especially this coffee cup. Very easy website. Shipped as promised and arrived as promised.,7
Fast delivery! Great product True to size n comfort,7
I prefer 100% soft cotton but the material used was ok,7
I love your selection of Simpson t-shirts and hoodies for my husband. There is a manufacturing odor that requires several days of exposure in fresh air to dissipate.,7

"The quality of the garments was good, I just wish the preview pictures would have been more accurate. For both images, they were not designed for darker fabric and so are very washed out looking and hard to see. The preview pictures did not show this. I was a bit sad that their cool art was hard to see.",7
I was expecting solid metal or plastic magnets not the bendable junk I received.,7
Loved the t-shirts and stickers. The designs are really cool and the quality is fantastic,7

I would definitely order again if I'm looking for a unique gift!",7

I have not washed them yet, so I hope that the image does not fade bc we loved these shirts! Will be buying from this website again if we see how the shirts handle some wear and tear. Shipping and delivery was super straightforward and package arrived quickly and undamaged.",7
My order was wrong and the prints are faded on most. It took 3 orders for them to get it right. I appreciated them consistently trying to right thier wrongs but 3 times is a lil much.,7

Customer service needs to improve!Shirts took longer to get here. After I placed my order I tried to change the color of one of the shirts. I even emailed customer service and did not get a reply.

My shirt was great quality and shipped quickly.Lots of fun designs! And great prices,7
"All my orders took over a month to even ship. The shirt I ordered was packaged fresh after printing, so the image stuck to itself and was ruined. I also ordered a mask that ended up looking nothing like the style they advertised, which ruins the imagery on it. (AKA the whole reason I ordered it) It���������s also already falling apart. It���������s shame such awesome artists use this sit",7

Both black hoodies came early and were a perfect fit. I would have given TeePublic 5-stars had the prices been a little lower, but then again, they ARE supporting artists, and artwork is of value.",7

Great shirts but they smelled like vinegar upon arrival. Definitely wash them first.,7
Loved the selection. Easy to order.,7
"The tshirt I ordered came in faster than I expected which was great! The print was a little dull, I thought it would be brighter. I tried to rip the tag off of the bottom of the tshirt (the little white one at the bottom seam) and the shirt ripped a big hole. My hands could easily rip the fabric. I didn't expect that at all. It was my fault for not using scissors to cut the tag in the first place, but the fabric should not have ripped that easily. We are just going to bunch the tshirt to one side and put a rubberband around it like the girls like to do. This shirt is for my daughter's 10th birthday in June.",7

Love the long sleeve shirt. Your sizing guide is the best I���������ve ever seen. My husband is usually between sizes and with your help his shi,7
Tee Public you are an Amazing company ! I am so glad I found you. Your customer service and delivery is impeccable.You go above and beyond for your customers.You are one of the Best company's I have ever done business with. Keep up the great work !,7
Swift response very helpful will definitely buy again,7
"Only just discovered this company. I found their website incredibly easy to navigate (much better than the well know business I have been using for years!). Placed an order for three different mens tees. They arrived within 7 days. I realised I had made a big error in sizing which was totally my fault. I contacted TeePublic and they responded within an hour or so, and made it easy (and blameless!) for me to rectify my mistake. I am very impressed with their customer service and highly recommend them and also the quality of the product I received.The only small issue I have is that I sometimes buy for a very tall young man who can only wear extra long tees. The other company I previously used has a ���������long tee��������� section which I did not notice on TeePubl",7
Shirts came as ordered.,7
Love the t-shirts this is my second time ordering from TeePublic. Quality materials and never have issues with getting my items on time.,7
"I wasn't sure if this was a legit website.I ordered a shirt for my grandson and am happy with it.Communication was good, shipping was good, and the shirt is as described.",7
"I paid $13 for shipping on my order and it was supposed to be guaranteed before Christmas, it wasn't until I reached out a final time an entire month after submitting my order that customer support FINALLY replied. My original package was sitting in a fedex warehouse before Dec 24th. And When customer support finally replied to my email they sent a new shipment and that one took an additional week and a half to get here. And if I hadn't reached out they wouldn't have done anything about it. As a business don't you track to make sure that the shipment gets to your customer on time as well? The Tshirt finally arrived in MINT condition, so truly no complaints there, but the after math of waiting over a month for an item that was supposed to arrive in 2-3 business from order date is ridiculous. I would like to be refunded my shipping if possible considering the crazy delay. Please let me know what you can do.",7
"The shirts are great quality... Bella���������s canvas. I ordered 4.Unfortunately, one of the shirts looks like it was smeare",7
Really loved my America the band t-shirt! Wished I had found it sooner. Would definitely recommend TeePublic!,7
I ordered a shirt that seemed way too small for what my usual size M son would fit into. I asked about trading for a size Large and got an immediate and incredibly helpful response! Very impressed!,7
Great price and fast shipping . Tshirts look great !!!,7
Everything I���������ve purchased with the exception of one thing has been awesome and the one problem was not the fault of the artists it was there shipping department I will continue to order the shirts ,7
"Slogan on mask was cut off at the bottom and is unreadable.VERY apparent to anyone that would have looked.Bought it as a Christmas gift, but unlikely to get one now.Sent notice to them.Not sure what their response will be or how quickly they will address the problem. Very poor quality control.",7
Everything was easy and delivered on time. Nothing wrong.,7
"Great design. Glad i didn't use Amazon. Kid loved the design, bought as a gift.",7
"TeePublic delivered exactly what I ordered, on time and in good condition. I have no complaints.",7
"The designs are great. The shirts themselves are garbage. No name, China paper thin.You will be embarrassed to wear them. Update 9/16 : Teepublic posts a reply here publicly to give the perception that they care about the customer and want to make things right. they ask you to fill out a contact form give them all of your personal info, then guess what...... You never hear from them.Just adds insult to poor products.",7
The tees I ordered arrived and they're perfect!! I can't wait for my son to see them on Christmas morning!!!,7
I have ordered from Teepublic several times and have loved all of their shirts.Tons of options available and quality product!,7

"Came on time, great quality",7
"Fast service. Great quality out of the package. Fits perfectly, XS tank. Beautiful colors on the screen print of a festive Jack Russell who is ready Cinco D'Mayo. Arrived quickly.",7
I had the best customer service experience ever! I had debated between two different sizes of shirts and when one arrived it was just too small. I wrote on a Saturday evening that I would like to exchange it for a large. I heard back from someone within just a couple of hours! I was so impressed to hear back on the weekend. I was also excited that my shirt was exchanged for free! Usually it is such a hassle to make returns and you all made it so easy. I can't wait to wear this shirt all baseball season!,7
This shirt was extremely small to be a women's XL.The fit was more like a Small.I am not returning it since my 14 yr daughter can fit it.But either buy 3 sizes up or get a men's shirt.,7
We ordered the premium toddler tees and are happy with the quality. Will definitely order again!,7

"I got my whole order wrong, when it came to sizes. Plus one, that l personally wasn't happy with. And it was just with the spelling of the word ""whiskey.""They were all gifts, and l wanted to be happy with what l was giving to my friends. TeePublic came through, fixing my mistakes. Their patience was a plus, when it came to me, and the process of reordering. It was another positive purchasing experience from TeePublic. Thanx again. I will be back.",7
"Good quality material, rich color, large printed image is vivid and better than expected.",7
Great pricing and Great delivery!Great designs on my magnets!I love them,7
We have purchased 3 items from your company so far. All movie themed onesies for our sons monthly pictures. We are happy with the quality of the design. Only reason for one less star is your shippingIs unpredictable. Not sure which companies you use but some orders have arrived super fast and others very late even lost for a while.,7

TeePublic kept us up to date on the status of our order. The t-shirt images were true to the online examples.,7
The shirts are great! The white ink on a blue shirt was a little thin and could have used another layer. The white on purple was fine.,7
Amazing product. Very high quality,7

"Fast, delivered way earlier than expected! Exactly what I ordered! Very impressed as a first time buyer.",7
"i love the design of the shirts, my only criticism is that some of the shirts i ordered the print is so blurry, i cant wear it, just looking at it makes me and who ever tries to look at it feel dizzy. it looked like as they were screen printing it they moved it/ or the ink bled. ordered 6 shirts and 3 are gonna be used as a whatever shirt kind of deal. Just sucks because they were suppose to be Christmas gifts.",7
Loved every thing about this shirt!,7
"Great company , excellent customer service , fast shipping. Shipping is over priced. Not happy with the shipping rates.Company uses DHL instead of ups or usps.",7
My experience was great because the sweater that I ordered it was too small and the awesome company that you are you were sending me an extra large for absolutely free! And I will be doing more business with you in the future,7

"The shirts and baby onesie that i purchased were great!!I wish there was an option for more shirt colors though, because perhaps i may have gotten a pink onesie as well, due to the fact that we have a little girl on the way....(but dad wanted a matching shirt, so i went with black for the entire family).It worked out in the end!! But i probably would���������ve purchased a pink one as well if it were an option.I am a happ",7
"The sweatshirt itself it very nice. Good quality, perfect size. But the colors were misleading. I chose I Heather Gray sweatshirt and the darker writing 'speechless' was almost thr exact color. It makes it very difficult to read the 'speechless' and also blocks off parts of the 'helpless' word. The photo online was very misleading, it shows a much greater contrast in grays. It was a Christmas present for my daughter, that took awhile to go get in. Since there are no returns, I won't be getting one that I would be extremely happy with. Had the picture been fully accurate and I chose to order a different color this would be an entirely different review with 5 stars all the way. So advise to the next person, pay attention to the colors.",7
The coolest t shirt company on the web! I always find what im looking for and my t shirts are always making people talk! keep up the good work!,7

Great job.I appreciate the quality.,7
Great quality shirts. Mine was perfect,7
"Ive ordered a dozen or so shirts over the last 2 years, and even gifted out a few. Ive been a satisfied customer, thus my repeat business. I did have 1 shirt that had major issues with the image falling off of the shirt, I originally wrote it off as a cheap product, but the others held up much better. After my last purchase, I was sent this prompt for a review, so I decided to spend a few minutes in my busy life to take a picture of the shirt with the image that clearly had fallen off the shirt. Response was sorry, I didn't let them know soon enough. Fair enough. Life is busy, life is short. Would have been great to have gotten a better answer, something along the lines of, ""we see you have ordered from us numerous times, and clearly our product was not up to our standards based on your picture, heres a fair remedy""... but whatever. You asked me again for an honest review.The majority of shirts I've ordered have been great. Thanks for the variety to choose from.",7
Unique. Good quality. Looks and fits true. Received quickly.,7
Good quality. Got here quick . Will order again . Most excellent people keep up the good work,7
great products and received package earlier than expected,7
"I ordered a women's v-neck t-shirt and because it said the cut was fitted I went a size up. The shirt arrived and I loved it, but it was too small. I emailed TeePublic to ask about exchanging it for a larger size. They couldn't have been more helpful. They immediately sent me a new shirt in the next size and told me to donate or give away the shirt that is too small. I'm very impressed with the customer service and the t-shirt!",7

"Slow shipping. T-shirts shoved into a bag. Poor quality printing, mis-aligned image and overspray. Spammed with multiple emails per day.",7
"This is the worst screenprinting job I have ever seen.Completely oveerpriced, absolute ripoff.",7
Always prefer you to others as sizing makes more sense. Also you ship in Canada which makes things much better.,7
"The shirt I ordered came quickly, fit perfectly and looks great. I haven���������t washed it yet, so I can���������t speak to how well the design holds up to wash and wear. But so far so good. My only complaint is the cost of shipping. $7 seems a bit steep to ship a single shirt in a plastic envelope package. Other than that",7
My order came quickly and was just what I expected. You have wonderful choices!,7
"Waste of money. The shirts were poor quality and the images look totally different, colors were off. Not worth the $100 spent",7

I paid a bit more for premium tees and they are so soft. Great design options that are unique. I have told several friends about the site and options for gifts.,7
"I ordered a t-shirt and four stickers. I was notified that the stickers would ship separately, which is fine. The t-shirt arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what I ordered; the 'stickers' arrived not long after, but were not exactly what I ordered. What I actually received was an empty envelope. I've submitted a query on this, but as I only got half of what I actually ordered, I can only give half-marks.",7
Wow!Got item in time and in super condition.Would purchase from thisseller again.,7
Ordered over 150 dollars worth of products for Christmas. Over half of my order didnt arrive on time.,7
High quality shirt with a creative design. Worth the wait.,7
Always find great designs and the shirts are extremely soft.,7

Great recovery. Love all the tees. It's my favorite ""tee shoppe!"" :-) And I love supporting those in the ARTS!",7
"The selection is amazing and the quality of the shirts is very nice. That said, do NOT underestimate their guidance of sizing up. I ordered a large for a friend (her normal size) and had to give the shirt to my 8 year old daughter and order her a 2xl.",7
"Ordered 2 shirts, one for me, one for my son, and they look great and arrived quickly. Will order more soon.",7
Great design; only place I could find what my son wanted!Definitely a 5 star product!,7
"I was emailed a ""how did we do?"". Which simply linked me back to the site home page. Hardly personal. And have yet to receive a response to my feedback on my issue -3 of 3 women's shirts have sizing issues- rendering them $13 or $20 paint rags. With regards to that: did I get a deal on the $13 dollar shirt or ripped off on the $20 shirt. Price hopping does not instill loyalty. Finally, there was a shirt of interest, but as I tried to order it , other products showed up. It took a while to read the fine print the shirt was no longer available. So why show it? Bait and switch? Just save time - show what you have...because ...the anime shirt I want...well I found and ordered on RedBubble. Product issues too.",7
The print left alot to be desired. I'm sure after the first wash it will fade heavily. Very low quality print.,7

"I love finding unique and/or niche gifts and Teepublic was the perfect place for that. FedEx incorrectly marked my package as delivered and upon contacting Teepublic���������s customer service via email, I immediately received a response and was sent my replacement on rush order. I should mention that this happened during the week of Christmas when orders are at an all-time high and all methods of shipping are extremely chaotic and backed up so, customer service really came through for me. The only downside to the rushed replacement order was that the quality of the t-shirts was slightly affected. The printed design was faded, less saturated/vibrant, and the t-shirt itself seemed much flimsier than the original order.I received my replacement in about 2 business days though and that was more than enough",7

"here's why i'm giving u a 3 ... first tho, the art is great & the tshirt quality is great. however, there are some customer service aspects that make u overall dislike u as a company & this is from current experience & previous experiences. any other place online i order from will send an IMMEDIATE or just about immediate email stating when i can expect my package. not a range of dates, but an estimated date. i have no idea how u guys do things but that never happens when ordering from u. it can take several days for that to happen & when i'm dropping $30 for a tshirt including s&h, i expect more. now this previous time, my package showed up quick, but i had BASICALLY ZERO communication from your company the entire time. that is far below any industry standard currently. & enough claiming covid issues. it's been a yr. everyone has had time to figure it out. so, figure it out. do better. mainly, do better for the artists u represent. other than that i love your tshirts, love the art, but i am always hesitant to buy from u. i actually hunt various locations for the design BEFORE buying from u & buy from u pretty much as a last resort.",7
I received the t- shirt I ordered promptly and it was correct. The fees are reasonable and I loved the selection options. I recommend TeePublic to anyone looking for a unique gift.,7
"I ordered two t-shirts with plans to give them as Christmas presents. Even though tracking said they were delivered, I never received the package and porch surveillance videos confirm that the package was not delivered. I waited several days before contacting customer service, hoping the package was delivered to a neighbor. They were very understanding, and resent the t-shirts with no further questions. Although they did not arrive in time for Christmas, they are now on their way to my grandsons.",7

I placed my order one month before I needed it thinking that was plenty of time. A little over a week after I placed my order I received an email that due to COVID-19 orders were behind schedule. I responded to that email notifying that I needed t-shirts by a certain date. If I did not receive the shirts by that date I would need to cancel. No one ever respond. I could not find a way to communicate besides leaving emails. No phone contact no one ever responded to my emails. Will not use this service again.,7

"I placed an order on 3/28 with Teepublic.They used DHL to mail the package.Today is the 04/15 and DHL hasn't updated tracking for the package since 4/2.Everytime I tried to get and update from DHL the only way to contact them was through an automated messaging text system that gave no information and advised to contact the company where I made my purchase.I contacted Teepublic by chat because that is the only way to get ahold of a live agent, there's not phone number to contact and a group email and that is it.I let them know the situation and they stated the only thing they could do is reorder a new package, ground shipping with UPS.They used UPS this time I'm guessing because they have had issues with DHL.As I would not receive my package for another 4-7 days, I asked for a credit or for the package to be shipped immediately.They ignored my request repeating that they have placed another order with ground shipping.They refused to let me speak with a manager and we're not willing to do what was right.I asked to cancel the order and refund my card.The agent did that with no problem.This company would rather lose your business than do what was right.I will never use this company again.Awful customer service.",7

I purchased a hooded sweatshirt with Tweetie bird on it especially for my Autistic grandsons 6th birthday. Finding a pattern suitable for a child was not an easy task since Looney Tune characters are not the rage right now. This website offered so many choices it was fantastic!!!I found exactly what I knew would thrill him. The quality is superior.The colors are bright and vibrant. It is a thick and warm sweatshirt and the sizing is correct. What more could I ask for? When he opened the package he squealed with joy.Case closed. Perfect purchase as far as I'm concerned!!!!!,7

"Excellent very good price , it' s fine if you give Free shiping when somebody spenda certain quantity of money .",7
I love the way my shirts turned out. My daughter shirts were a little too big but I'm going to keep them. She'll grow into them. I always buy from Teepublic and have always been satisfied with my purchases. The only issue I have with Teepublic is that I wish Teepublic had free shipping and not just for purchases for 80 dollars or more but for purchases in general because depending on how many items you buy determines your shipping and tax free which is way too high even when you only purchase one item. The shipping fee along with the tax fee is just about as high as it is for just one shirt by itself.,7
Love the mug. Love the picture.Got it earlier than expected.,7

"Bought the shirt for my daughter, she absolutely loved it!!! Art work is on point, material is super soft cotton, and it was delivered extremely fast!!",7
"The shirt was a little tight, even though I ordered after looking at the size chart and comparing pretty well with one of the models. And then the design was pressed off center and it was stuck together when I took it out of the package. It tore off part of the design",7
Outstanding tee!! Definitely was surprised how soft and great the graphics were. I will always order from you guys from now on,7
Yesterday yall delivered me a subways custom shirt instead of H-E-B custom shirt,7

Bought the Tshirts and they arrived fast and high quality for Bubby and Papa....highly recommend!,7
First order was lost in the mail.I filed a claim with Canada Post and let TeePublic know.Before I heard back from Canada Post TeePublic had already sent the replacement order.Fast Friendly Service.,7
I bought the classic cheap trick band shirt. It was the first shirt that came up in my search. It was hard to tell on the page because of the design but says cheap pr&$k which i do not want at all and can not wear. Nothing was listed or saying it says that instead. No refund no return no nothing just it���������s printed its yours. Great custom service especially ,7

This is one of the only companies i by from they are great on every level.,7

On 12/5/22 I placed order #13187008 for a Coffee Mug and a Hoodie.I chose EXPEDITED shipping (3-5 business days) because I needed it for our office party on 12/10/22.That's right!I was naive and stupid enough to pay $33.99 to have it here on time.I received the mug on 12/13/22 and I've heard NOTHINGabout when the Hoodie might arrive.Today is 12/14/22.WTH?????????,7
Service was good.Website is easy to use. Delivery time is good considering product is custom. Packaged well.,7

"Nice quality, fast shipping, good price. I recommend hang drying because the logos/designs fade after a few runs in the dryer",7
I'll start by sharing that I never draft online reviews. TeePublic definitely deserves one. The company went above and beyond to correct the sizing of a shirt that I purchased. They were professional and efficient. They corrected the issue immediately upon my request. They have great selection and I couldn't be happier with the experience.,7
I ordered two magnets for our cruise.They didn't arrive till after we left! Was not a happy camper.They were not a special order with personalized info so should have been here in plenty of time.They are cute but not sure if I will get to use them,7
I order a 5x shirt every Christmas for my nephew from TeePubic and he always loves it. There are so many choices and when I find the right design I am excited because I know he will love it.,7

Size runs small. My grandson is an average size 2 year old I bought a size 4 and I���������m not sure it will be big enough That is the shirt,7
Fast delivery.It looks as advertised.Would shop again.,7
Love shirts!!! Pink with soft greenish-white font is a little hard to read from farther away but have been wanting soft pink shirts for a while so am pleased with these shirts! Love the service! I may order same shirt in navy blue and white because of the food fast service! Yay ����������,7
I really loved the shirts. One was red and the picture on it was perfect. The other one was black and the picture on it was very blurry. The designer did a wonderful job on the picture but I guess something may have happened to the heat press on my black shirt. I will only wear around the house �����,7
It seems as though the shirt was packaged before it dried after the press was applied. Which left the shirt feeling a little weird on the front.,7
Good quality. Quick and easy!,7
My son loves the shirt. very comfortable and excellent customer service.,7
"Great job, much better than I expected.",7
I believe my t-shirt is terrible quality with a terrible print and so long it might as well be a dress. I would not buy such a t-shirt in a store as I would know beforehand how cheap it is.Such a pity as I wanted to support the artist.,7
They do great work ! I buy from this place all the time keep up the good work all of the artists. We love it,7
Great online store. Quick shipping and a great online store. You are sure to find a piece of clothing to suit your personal tastes.,7
I ordered a number of t-shirts (6) for Christmas this year to kind of break up the norm.All of the items were received in a timely fashion and were of high quality and I look forward to the faces of the recipients.,7
"Sweet shirts for unsweet times, dudes.",7
Loved everything except for my boyfriend's items were way too small.I just can't rave about how stoked I am and will be doing A LOT of shopping from the artists I purchased from. Hopefully will find more artists and designs to love.The fact that I was able to find Rurouni Kenshin themed apparel is just beyond Comprehension! I am beyond ecstatic. Anime really shaved a lot of my childhood and teen years and I truly have a soft spot for it. Now I'm able to wear it loud and proud!The designs were printed neatly and beautifully and also are so unique! Be Samurai Jack shirt and Fullmetal Alchemist pullover or unfortunately smaller than what was expected but it's all good hopefully I can get them in a bigger size for my boyfriend.Going to be ordering for my mom pretty soon as you like some unique things as well that I think we'll be able to find on here. You guys have a customer for life!,7
"Understood orders, quick delivery and nice merchandise.",7
Excellent customer service. My size didn't fit and they sent out the correct size. Awesome!,7
"Would have given it a 5, but ran small and I had to exchange it. I am 5'4"" and a size 6 or 8 in shirts and small busted. The size small was tight. Went with a medium.",7
Had a sizing problem but they exchanged everything and quickly!,7
T shirts were delivered quickly. T shirts are true to size Very satisfied with purchase. Would not hesitate to purchase again.,7
"Company shipped fast and and took payment easy. However, the quality of the sweatshirt I receive was I felt low, and the graphic quality/print was horrible. Won���������t purchase another item ",7

Totally professional and amazing service and products!!,7
"Great store, very fast delivery time, my go to on line store��������",7
"The shirts are high quality..all 7 of them. I'm an extra large in the shirts are definitely an extra large. They fit really well better than most t-shirts. They don't shrink when they're washed, if they do they only shrink in length and that's okay because they're a little long when they arrive. I'm old school so all I wear is pretty much t-shirts so I can definitely attest to that these are some of the best I've ever worn as far as size quality and price.",7
Arrived quickly and my daughter loves the shirt!,7
Nice products. Took a little long for shipping but it was a nice shirt.,7
"Fun slogans!Love all the custom, fits not just small, medium, large, etc!",7
My item arrived super fast and I have no complaints!,7
Love the shirt! Huge size and design is great. Good quality shirt.,7
They were accepting of mistakes and fixed my order for free after I accidentally ordered the wrong size,7
I loved my product and it came very quickly. The company reached out to me to make sure I didn't have any issues with my product after it was delivered. I would recommend ordering from this company and I would order products again from them.,7
THE BEST WEBSITE FOR T-SHIRT!!! 5 STAR SERVICE FAST DELIVERY!,7
Cheap material washed it and now it only fits my 10 year old not happy done with your third world product this is AMERICA not Bangledesh or Pakistan better yet China.You should focus on better quality not cheap foreign made that's produced in sweat shops.Get with the program or you will be out of business real quick..,7

The masks were paper thin and it took over 2 months arrive. I will never buy from your company again.,7
"They have the funny for your tummy.Great collection of awesome themes for kids, adults and the older folks out there. Have a wife with a real lack of humor? Prefect, cause I���������ve seen the reaction on the faces of the people I love as they scrunch up their faces cause myself and only 4 other people understand the kickass obscurity of the shirt you are rocking. Do you have a super random thing you are into? Come on down cause if you look long enough you will find it. I cannot stress enough that you will find something you like.T",7

"Wrong size and cut delivered (Women's XL arrived. Ordered Men's 3xl). No number to call, only an email where they tell you it can take a week to get back to you. It's been over a week, and nothing. Guess I bought an expensive towel to dry my car with. First and last time I will order anything through them . It's too bad, because they have some great looking shirts,",7

I ordered two small men���������s T-shirt���������s. When they arrived one of the shirts was noticeably smalle,7
My account was deactivated without explanation. No one responded to my multiple emails.,7

"The Cramps shirt alone would have been enough as I have been trying to find that particular tee.The others (especially the Ween tee but the others too!) were super cool also.I got them on the sale for $16 bucks too, which is gorgeous!In retrospect, the Television and Velvet Underground tees are as excellent.I'll be back on the next sale.",7

Great product shirts fit and designed well...,7
"Shirt was as ordered, soft and the design was great.",7
"Great website, anything I type into the search bars generates a large selection of options. If you can think of it, someone on here has already done it and created shirts, hoodies, mugs, or stickers to bring that thought to life.",7
It took a while to arrive which is why I didnt give five stars i would like to give 3 and a half stars but u can't do that.The colour of the writing on the shirt was very faded looking and to be honest it doesn't look like it will withstand a good wash in the machine but I haven't washed it yet because I'm too scare the writing will come off or become cracked and nasty looking.I will have to see what it looks like once washed to be sure really,7
Good value and quality t-shirt. very happy with the purchase.,7
Very good communication and fast shipping!,7
My card got stolen immediately after making a purchase,7
Tee public is good with pricing. They also offer additional discounts.,7
The shirt is fracking rad and I got it much quicker than I thought!,7
When I first got my hoodie I thought that the color was a little bit light but the more I looked at it the better it.got I really like the artist not making the colors too loud it's very subtle it doesn't take any effort to look at the design I like her work a lot I would order something up for her no problem or he whoever the artist is,7

Love the Lego DesignsWe ordered two of the lego design sweatshirts for our granddaughters who live in the Northwest. Appreciated the design however we are trusting that the sizes will be correct. We got sizes from their parents and the youth small looked especially little when it arrived at our home.The youth Large looked more size appropriate. Trusting they will fit. Hoping the girls will enjoy them during these cold wet months..,7
I purchased a t shirt that was too small. I was taken care of quickly and easily. Great customer service!,7
Fast. Affordable. Fun and unique items. Great customer service,7
"Enjoy the fact that there are shirts that match every subject, age, size, and different maturity levels.The fact that you let the artists truly be themselves is what sets you apart from competitors.The biggest factor aside from the above mentioned is that there are so many colors to choose from.It drives me insane to find a shirt on a different site that only offers black, white, grey, dark blue, and dark green.I live in Texas and white shirts are okay, but don't look different from anyone else.The dark colors just suck up heat and we are hot most of the year.Thanks for being there TeePublic.",7
"I have been wanting to purchase a shirt from here for a long while. I finally broke down and bought my Mom one for Mother's Day...she is in love with it! The print covers all of the front, which I wasn't expecting however we both found it to be fantastic. The colors were very bright and vibrant, details were all as shown and the words were legible too. Came in the size and color I ordered, and fit her just fine with the looseness she likes. She said it is soft on the outside, however the inside (where it counts) is so very soft. It even got here 4 days before the estimate, just in time as an added bonus! Also, it washes beautifully; the colors are just a vibrant and the print was unaffected. I even accidentally put it in the dryer on high and with some slight stretching the shirt went back to its comfortable loose setting lol. Definitely recommend the seller and TeePublic, I've found another hit site! :D",7
The tee���������s were just like they were advertised. They fit great ! I recommend this company to anyone wanting a qual,7
"Nice print. But, the quality of the shirt was not what I expected. It's a rather thin material. I expected better quality for the price.",7

Brilliant fit and excellent quality. Better than I imagined.,7
Perfect! Exactly as ordered.,7
"Shirt is the quality listed on the site, but the ���������blue��������� of the logo is a muted gray. The logo is also very blurry and pixelated.

"I���������m very happy with this company! For the shirt I ordered, it was recommended to order 1-2 sizes larger. Normally, I���������m a small/medium, so I ordered a large. It was still on the small side so I wanted to exchange it for an XL. They responded to my request quickly sent out the new size right away. They even told me to keep the other size��������� I love that I didn���������t have to has",7

"This was my second T-shirt. I usually wear a medium to large. My first T-shirt was a large, but way too tight.After contacting the company an extra large was sent at no charge so large T-shirt was given to charity.

I absolutely love my Michael Myers shirt. I���������ve received so many compliments about it. It���������s a great fit. I will say the package was left on my front porch without a single knock.

Excellent! Great experience. Nice Tee Shirts. Unique!,7
Always a great fit for plus size tees. The one shirt I ordered is supposed to appear somewhat worn/vintage but it's so much that it's barely legible.,7
"I hate to leave a bad review but the quality of the shirt I received was really subpar. The cotton shirt itself is fine, but the print on there (the whole reason for ordering it) is horribly fuzzy and pixelated... basically the small thumbnail image got blown up bigger without any attempt at increasing the resolution, to the point where the lack of definition on the font almost makes it unreadable against the background image. Really disappointed by this purchase.",7
Love the t shirts.Shipment was quick.Would definitely buy from them again,7
The mask could have been a lot better cause I was very excited but the design was faded and the stitching wasn���������t there so it could have,7

The shirt is a wonderful design and perfect gift for my friend.,7
I received my product and it looks great but the size is too small for what I expected to be an XL and will need an exchange,7

The most terrible experience I ever had ordering online. I request a refund because I place 1order with 3 items and only receive 1 item and it's been 3weeks. I sent mess. to da website because they not accepting calls. Nobody reach out to me yet. Dat was around 10 days ago. Never again.,7
"***Update***I did hear from company, rather quickly. They did give me a refund for the extra shipping charges, although I still haven't received my sticker. (Original)I ordered a hoodie, t-shirt and a sticker. I only received the hoodie and t-shirt. Hopefully I get the sticker I paid for as well. Also I paid 2 separate shipping fees for the hoodie and t-shirt and they were shipped together. Besides these 2 issues, that I hope will be resolved, everything looks great.",7
Shirts are a little small for the states sizes.,7

"I was so excited to find that you offer v-neck t-shirts!Regular t-shirts with teeny tiny neck holes choke me.They fit great and I will order v-necks from you from now on!I am a music teacher, and decided I wanted to have a variety of t-shirts to wear to school.I love my new shirts!I ordered two v-necks and two crew-necks.Yes, the crew-necks choke me, but I went ahead and kept them.Any further orders will, of course, be v-necks!I ordered a mug, and I was disappointed to find the graphic was only printed on one side, and the opposite side than I usually find the graphics on.I would suggest you put it on both sides of the mug.Yes, it was displayed accurately on the website, but it did escape my notice, as I was only looking at the design.It is also nice to know that if I have a shirt idea I would like, I can design it myself and then order it.Thank you for a great online experience.",7

"Beautifully designed mask, although needed a bit of modification to make it usable - didn't have a nose wire, and the filter pocket wasn't sealed at the sides.Worth it though, despite that.",7

"The designs are wonderful of course and the shirts are soft and very wearable, but unfortunately the prints come out far too dark and the print itself feels cheap and thin. Almost like an iron on transfer you���������d buy at Walmart. I�����",7
I purchased this as a birthday present for my son. The look on his face when he saw it was priceless! The shirt even came in 3 days early putting it here the day before his birthday instead of after!,7
"Good quality shirt, good price. Production is timely but shipping leaves something to be desired.",7
"Tons of great options, easy procedure, and shipped well!",7
"It's great to be able to ""customize"" your shirts by selecting the color of shirt to complement the print design, but you don't always have a full fange of colors to choose from.Also, I would like to see more 'in-between' colors standardly available;say a buttercup yellow, more varied/less intense greens, blues, purples, etc....do you really need a fistful of grey options but only only one yellow and one orange, for example?Yes, there are times I would pay a bit extra to get JUST the right color if I had the option!",7
"Service from the site was good; however, the quality of the screenprinting on my tee is poor. Low coverage = lack of vibrant colors. I saw someone wearing this shirt and that is why I searched for and purchased it. His was far superior. I would have returned it, but the message is time-sensitive.",7
TeePublic has always provided reliable service. They have a great selection of items and really good customer service.,7
"The design is darling and well placed.The problem is with the sizing.Seeing that it is 100% cotton, I ordered an XL to allow for shrinkage.Thing is, it fits like a Medium even before washing.It was supposed to be a surprise gift for my daughter, but it definitely won���������t work.S",7
Doesn���������t match pic ! Woul,7

Returning customer and will be returning often. This is my favorite site to order from.,7
Quality of the printed goods was mediocre at best.,7
"There was an error in the original shirt sent, but they acted swiftly to correct it. My son loves his shirt!",7
The art on the shirts is fantastic. The shirts themselves are way too small. All of my other shirts are Men's Medium and I can wear them very comfortably. Your Men's Medium is way too tight. I can't wear the shirts I bought.,7
"Good quality in tee shirts. One of my t shirts was fine, the other, the graphic was subpar. When I contacted TeePublic, they made it right by asking me to choose a different color tee and they sent me the new one (the graphic is still not perfect) and told me to keep the original, all at no cost.",7
Product arrived VERY quickly and fit perfectly. I love it!,7
Ordered from Canada.Good quality products.This company is trustworthy.,7
Shipping was great,7
Wonderful Christmas gifts!,7
"Shirt that I received was NOT what I ordered! Completely misrepresented! It was advertised as an exact replica of the "" No Ma'am"" shirt from Married With Children tv show. I received a shirt with the logo on front ( oversized ) and NOTHING on the back! Total rip-off!!! It was even listed as a 2 sided shirt!!!",7
"The items were as ordered and arrived in a timely manner. They were a little overpriced, perhaps, but their uniqueness makes it worth it.",7
"The only thing from keeping this out of a 5 star was my package was in limbo for many days. But customer service was top notch and was gonna make it right had I not received it at all. Product is a 10/10. I shouldn't even discount for the shipping, because it's technically not their fault, but unfortunately something has to take the fall a bit. 0 stars for USPS, if that makes it better lol. Overall, will definitely order again and recommend them to anyone looking for high quality shirts",7
I like the shirt. But the shipping took to long other than that I'm happy with your product.,7

"I fell in love with seeing some the nostalgic t-shirts on this site and ordered a few for Christmas gifts. The customer service was incredible and I've already let my friends and family know about this cool site. I can't wait to see my favourite people open up their t-shirts! (I couldn't help myself and bought a t-shirt for myself too!)The quality of the shirts is very good. I loved to see the real-life models who model the sizing (this helped a LOT with determining which size I needed to choose)I rarely share reviews, but have been extremely happy with this purchase and will buy from TeePublic again.",7
"I created an account and uploaded artwork I created, using an old logo from my family���������s business.I placed an order for several items as a test, to see how the products came out, with the intention of ordering more items as gifts.A day or two after I created the account, I received an email from Teepublic stating that due to a ���������violation of terms of service��������� my account was cancelled and artwork deleted.I emailed the address provided, seeking clarification and have received no response in over a week.In addition, Teepublic never sought payment information from me and there���������s no indication that I will see ���������my cut��������� from the few items that sold.It would seem that, perhaps, Teepublic uses an automated process ",7
Item was as described..Delivered as promised..As of now everything is fine..,7
"We got exactly what we paid for, good quality.",7
Shirt size runs too small and not the quality of material that I was expecting.. Design was nice.,7
I really had no idea how careful you have to to be when washing this sweatshirt. This was a gift for someone in a nursing home. I'm afraid the first wash (no doubt in hot water and detergent) will destroy the artwork. You should have been more clear about how delicate this item is when being laundered.,7
I will definitely order from them again. I ordered 5 shirts and had to exchange 2 for a different size. No questions asked and the new order was placed same day. Great service!!,7

The tracking keeps telling me my mask I ordered is going to be delivered Wednesday 01/20/2021which well passes that date. I've emailed and spoke to a customer service agent and all they can tell me is the delivery and tracking states it will arrive the 26th....no where in the tracking do i see that. So because of this issue and experience i'm really not to sure.",7

TeePublic has been quick to respond to my inquiries regarding size exchanges or missing parts of my order.

The site was easy to navigate: it was easy to find the product(s) for which i was looking and to place an order. The order was shipped and arrived in a very timely manner.,7
Originally was going to give 0 stars cause my item arrived damaged thankfully person fixed it and i got my new one minus the extended wait for this replacement one star was dropped cause of that. For paying as much and it took so long to ship before and as well as for having a new one sent out? It should have been sent out express for the inconvenience. I am glad they gave a replacement but the extended wait is what will hurt this review. Next time when sending a replacement you should give as an apology express shipping cause it wasn't the customers fault more it was the consumer for sending a product that was either not tailored correctly or that you need to have someone verify the item doesn't have any defects when creating the garment or garments.,7

"I LOVE the graphic!! I recieved so many compliments on this shirt. I am a teacher and try not to be ""politcial"" in my classroom of second graders. This graphic sends the message loud and clear about my teaching philosophy. I was, however, very disappointed with the sizing on the T shirt. I normally wear a large, so I ordered an XL and it barely fits. I haven't even washed it yet!������������ otherwise this would ha",7
Love this site! You are able to find almost any graphic you want and they will probably have it. The shirts I got are high quality fabric. The only thing is the shipping can be slow. My order took almost a month to get here but I understand that COVID 19 has slowed their production and shipping time.,7
I will definitely use TeePublic again. They have a huge selection of shirts that my son loves and come in larger sizes for the fluffy people. Fast shipping and great quality and well. Highly recommend.,7

HiDelivery was longSize smaller than expectedThe printing on the T-shirt��������,7
The graphic looks faded as if it was printed on a cheaper printer. That���������s only one star off. The graphic was placed on the shirt crooked and not centered. It���������s a square logo so it���������s easy to see that���������s it���������s tilted and off to one side ,7
I received the shirt shortly after I ordered it.I am impressed by the quality of the shirt and the design.,7
I've gotten this design from different retailers with bad results twice.The image was blurry and the print started coming off in the wash.The Tee Public version is great so far in those categories and in comfort and fit!,7
Awesome shirt and shipped so fast! Love thus site!,7
"Very co operative when my order went astray, gave me a refund.",7
Mask is great but took so long to get it....,7
"Their t-shirt products are well printed. If there is a mistake they are quick to correct it and send you a new shirt. They seemed to have switched shirt manufacturers and the shirts are a little tighter, but still fits. Repeat customer of TeePublic. Greatly recommend.",7
"It was a gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it! The hoodie is so soft and was a little bigger than expected, but should shrink in the wash. The design on the hoodie looks great. Would definitely get another!",7
"I like the t-shirts, Hoodie and cup. The t-shirts were a couple days behind the cup in terms of delivery. Pretty good quality on everything but I really bought them for the message. It's time we stood up to all the lies that certain people continue to spread.",7
Really cool designs my only complaint is I wish the shipping was quicker,7
"Great shirts, great service.",7
The shirt is cute but the design is sloppily applied,7
I ordered the smallest shirt you had and was way too big for my 6 yr old. Need to have even smaller sizes since a lot of your shirts are for kids,7

Merchandise came on time and was made very well. Purchase was well-worth it. I would recommend!,7
"The case is good, the artwork beautiful, but it���������s a bit hard to g",7
High qualityand fast delivery!,7
The customer service here is excellent��������� I ordered a triple extra-large according to the measurement guidelines for my husband ina Heather color. Heather colors tend to not shrink as much and are softer. however the arm holes and the collarto shoulder section was a lot smaller compared to his other triple extra large shirts.so although I measured correctly according to their guidelines it was too small. I ordered a size 4X but as was afraid that it was going to be like a dress. It was actually the same width and length but bigger sleeve hole. But I had to get a different style shirt it had to be a solid shirt instead of Heather because Heather did not come in 4X..I would recommend ordering one shirt at a time just so you have an idea on what type size that you like. Then go back and order more. The customer service was outstanding. I would definitely orde,7
"Excellent experience!! Product arrived exactly on time and as described. When I saw that the size probably wouldn���������t fit who I bought the shirt for, they made the exchange process effortless and quick and I couldn���",7

So I contacted TeePublic explained that I incorrectly measured and I needed a 13 not a15 inch bag. No questions asked they processed the replacement and I had the correct bag in a week or so. They let me keep the incorrect one as well. Just Excellent customer service !",7
Fast an beautiful quality.will definitely buy more an tell family and friends,7
"Did you make that shirt at home with your PC printer or have it professionally printed?That's never a good question to hear, but one you might get with a TeePublic shirt.The print quality has been inconsistent at best and is often far off in color from the design purchased and even when correct looks more like a do-it-yourself PC Printer iron-on design than a screen printed shirt like you'd expect.The basic classic t's especially aren't worth it as the shirts they use are extremely low quality.If you must order from them go with one of the Gilden soft touch shirts which are much nicer to wear and hold up better after a wash.",7
"5/3/23I ordered a T-shirt for my daughter-in-law, and when it came it looked a little small, so I reordered it in a bigger size.The exchange policy was so easy and my new shirt came the following week.The quality of the shirt and it's graphics are top notch!I will definitely be a customer for years to come!Deb",7

Customer service is excellent! Had an order with defective item and reported it immediately. Within 24 hrs. customer service responded.Problem resolved and received a replacement in less than a week. Can���������t get much,7

"Highly recommend this company! Tee shirt is high quality, great fit, and attractive. Will order again.",7
"I am both buyer and seller of this order. While everything was eventually settled (sort of), I did not receive what I ordered by the deadline. The tees were meant to be for a specific event which I could not postpone. One package arrived damaged and late, with shirts missing. Two of the shirts had misprints. One package did not arrive at all. One of the misprinted shirts was allegedly the fault of the file, yet no communication about the file being ""bad"" happened and it conformed to the posted file specs on the website. When the replacement package finally arrived, one shirt was sized too small for the recipient, and there was yet another misprint-- neither of which I care to ask for a replacement or refund. I had intended to switch to Teepublic after many years of (more expensive) success with Neat-O-Shop. Looks like I will not be switching after all and will continue to shop your competitors.",7
"Looks good tome but giving to granddaughter for Christmas.So, she's the one to give the review.",7
"The selection is great. So many to choose from. In the past, some of your shirts did not last as long as I was hoping. The graphics faded quickly and some had little holes. Hopefully those problems have been fixed.",7
"I love my T-shirt but wish I would have read the reviews first because the sizing is way off meaning a size or more too small. I usually wear a medium, and I ordered a large just in case and even then it is tight on me. I won���������t be able to throw it in the dryer. Since my T-shirt ran small I recommend sizing up especially if you���������re going to be putting it in the dryer. This is a woman���������s size and aside from the sizing issue I love the T-shirt the graphics are amazing and I���������m hoping I can exchange it for a size bigger. Also as a side-note someone put in their review that there���������s a size disclaimer somewhere on the webpage.I did not see it and I assume others didn��",7
"The tee shirts I ordered were marked down from over 20 bucks to just 13. I thought that this was a good price and they were trying to get rid of them. I love the design and the color options. However, the quality of the shirt and the fabric is dirt cheap. I do not have great confidence that it will last.",7

"Artwork on the shirts is great. My only issue is that the artwork is way too big. It covers the entire shirt and it looks cheap. If the art was 1/3 smaller and sat on the upper chest, I'm sure you'd sell many more shirts. It would look much better.",7
Ordered with plenty of time to send as a gift tracking kept saying it was cing every day for 1 1/2 weeks so I missed shipping window for Christmas gifts. If it's not gonna be there just say so you can take me off your mailing list as I won't be buying anymore,7

So..This was my first time using this site.I wanted a playing card theme shirt. And they had one for 15 bucks..I ordered a men's small..they use DHL for shipping..so my comments..the shirt design is great..the shirt itself is not a soft cotton but a little scratchy. the men's small was narrow on me..but I got it wet and stretched it out to fit..and DHL shipping will make you crazy telling you your shipment will be late..delayed. ..and otherwise..but then show up exactly on time. Would I order from here again..Yes I would..for original designs you can't find elsewhere it's a great site.,7

Which is almost impossible to find these days. My shirt fit perfectly when it arrived. No returns, not too big not too small. Perfect.The design was even more detailed than what the picture showed, so the screen printing is fantastic. Never ordered from TeePublic before but may start making a habit out of it.",7

While chatting with the rep he disconnected, sent the wrong one and now they are only offering me 15% coupon instead of the item I paid over 50 bucks for. Had been a loyal customer for years. Not happy.",7

Great dealing with you guys but 27 weekly emails???It's just too desperate for my attention. If I need more shirts I'll do business w8th you again.

These guys are awesome! The shirt I ordered has beautiful high quality prints unlike I've seen anywhere else. Great material and Real heavy duty stuff. They do run slightly on the smaller side so be sure to order 1 or 2 sizes bigger. I initially recieved the wrong product but they contacted me back and resolved the issue right away.

The print on one of them was not even legible.The design on both shirts was all blurred and not what they described.I would return them,but since it took 2 months just to get them who knows how long a refund would be.They also smelt really bad Well live and learn and I know not to get ANYTHINGFROM TEE PUBLIC",7
Received my t-shirts. I love them!!So soft nice and true to size,7
Great company with amazing artists and apparel!,7
Excellent product and no issues. Arrived on time. Nice work.,7
Love the t shirt. Got it in less than a week and it fits perfect.,7
"Got my stickers yesterday and they look awesome! Received the T-shirt today and it is so comfy, it fits perfect and the 42nd Rainbow Division insignia on the front looks fantastic! Definitely will be ordering more! These are in memory of my father who was a pow in a German concentration camp during world war II",7
"Great T shirt, lovely fabric n motive, Purchased as a gift.Will definately return to look at this site again.",7
I ordered 2 t shirts but my package never arrived(tracking # just stopped getting updated). Contacted customer service and they were great! They offered to resend my package and this time it came just fine. Would definitely order again,7
"Good fit, came quick, would use again.",7
The shirt is of good quality and fits fine but the image is crooked. Since it���������s a t top there���������s less material and the fact that the image is crooked seems to stand out more than w,7
"Great shirts, great designs and great prices!!!",7
The processing and shipping really does take a long time (plus the tracking number still doesn���������t work after 48hours) and is very expensive. I would be hesitant to purchase from again ,7
T-shirt arrived on time and is good quality.,7
Great comfortable T-shirt���������s ,7
"I am pleased with your ordering system and my shirt was delivered in time.I am just a little disappointed because I thought the boots were glittered.I have no idea why I thought that, but I was convinced.",7
Shirts sizes fit differently could have used a bigger size,7
Awesome designs for my D&D group as a Christmas gift,7
Lots of creative choices. Quick shipping. Family loved the shirts!,7

Design came out really nice. It looks even better in person.,7
I really love the quality of the shirts and brings my designs to life with such vivid colors.I always come back to upload my customs shirts.,7
Great productWonderful job Shop there lots!,7
Nice t shirt but TINY!! (I ordered L women and it would fit a size 8-10) and rather poor quality fabric for price...a shame as nice designs.,7
I love the shirt. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was that originally they sent me someone else's shirt. I emailed about the problem and within only a few minutes they responded. The problem was solved post-haste and I have to correct shirt. Very impressed with the customer service!,7
Product arrived quickly - great quality material - finished product looks great.Have received several complements already.,7
"I ordered an XL, I had previously ordered XL perfect fit for me about 2 weeks prior, The shirts that I received now as XL are a different brand are run smaller.",7
"Good quality product, delivery on time",7
I ordered 9 shirts 3 for each of my kids. They absolutely loved them. My daughters favorite character is Holtzmann from Ghostbusters I bought her 3 awesome shirts. My older son just got an Oculus and I was able to find shirts to go with it. The little guy loves Ghostbusters Stay Puft...Teepublic.com even had 4T size for him. Love you guys! I Will continue to order from you.,7
Great material! And nice sticker look.,7
"The T-Shirts were perfect! The fit was fine, soft to the touch, true to size!",7
I saw the tee on social media. Loved the sentiment. The ordering process was easy.,7
"Ordered 4 mask...still waiting for one of them.They run a little big, but that's ok i can work with it. Many loose threads.Look like they were hurriedly made. I really think the snoopy is cute.A bit too expensive.",7
Great quality shirts and happy to support smaller artists. Tee's arrived very fast from USA to Canada all washed and ready to wear now with minimal shrinkage. The design is very well laid on and tees are comfortable breathable cotton. Will buy from again!!,7
"Bought this shirt for my boyfriend and he loves it! Design looked good (not cheap), shirt was as soft as advertised, and the fit was true to label size.",7
The shirts I ordered are good quality and came in exactly as ordered!,7
"The item that I purchased was a size for a small child. (2-x large) I was under the inpression that all of your items were adult sizes. Nothing in your advertisement stated other wise. I found it to be to much trouble to return the item, so I choose to keep it.",7
The shirt is nice but it takes too long for it to come. It was for a holiday event and it took over 2 weeks to get here. Obviously missed the event so hopefully I can wear it next year.,7
"Perfect... Size, fitting, quality. Colors don't fade. Great t-shirt. Easy to shop for what I was looking for. Speedy process. Love it.",7
I think my orders are getting delivered faster before. the designs still look great!,7
"Great T-Shirt. When I received my order and found out that my normal size was a little tighter than expected, customer service quickly resolved the issue and sent me a replacement size very quickly. This is very much appreciated.",7
"Quick service, quality tees. The only reason I only gave 4 stars is that some of the designs wear out / off fairly quickly. Less than a year.",7
Great fit and great for anti dictators! I'd recommend this shirt to all people wearing shirts.,7
"Just what I wanted, quick service.Gift got a wow from grandson.",7
Very cool artwork and ideas. Great quality too.,7
I received my product on time and my son loved his G-Mod t-shirt and hoodie I was searching all over the web for. Excellent quality too!,7
Masks were 100% polyester very hard to breathe through,7
New to this site. Order arrived quickly. Quality of work and quality of the t-shirt were great! Definitely will use TeePublic again!,7
I'm pleased. The only issue is the size... shirt is a bit larger than it appeared.,7
Received Futura sticker. Would give five stars if there was no delay in receipt.They made it right.,7
"The small t-shirt is actually an extra small. It's for a very small person, no more than 5 foot tall and weighing.no more than 80 lbs.",7
"All of my t-shirts, stickers, and hoodie were excellent quality and delivered very prompt.Highly recommend!!!!!!",7
There OK! The cotton is not the best quality for the price.I had to pay 22.00 custom feeI thought that would have been covered in the costThe graphics are a little dull and not as vibrant as they are depicted onlineThe most expensive tee shirts I have bought,7
Really crappy production. Logos are smudged on both sweatshirts. You clearly rushed this and did not care. I am embarassed and did not even want to give them as gifts. Have to figure you are better than this if you are in business. Would appreciate it if you tried to make it right.,7
Absoloutly love the tshirts we got.. One happy husband ..than you ����,7
"Honestly I was a bit surprised about how good the customer service was. Some shirts got lost in the mail, they resent them at no charge.

I like the things I got. I wish they cost less. I would have bought more.,7
Excellent return policy easy and no hassle,7
"I'm always happy with the designs but they are inconsistent with the tshirts that are used... they aren't always the same brand. For instance, I ordered a duplicate shirt that i had ordered once before. I ordered the same size and color but the size and color of the shirt i received was off since a different brand shirt was used.",7
"Merchandise was very good quality as promised; too often ""Heavy weight"" is used in the description but not used for the actual merchandise.",7
"Honestly excellent selection of prints, decently priced and great quality tees. Overall happy with my purchase. One down side, the color in the prints is see-through on some of the tees. Also one print has color variation in the middle of the head in the design.",7
I love my purchase!Dragon Sales Designs has an amazing selection and the quality of their shirts are great.,7

That you for the rad ������������ you guys and gals roc,7
"I think that it makes sense that you���������re doing custom designs that you wouldn���������t do returns, but it would be great if it was blasted all over your website. I also think if you offered more sizes like extra small and child sizes on some of your non-adult themed T-shirts that would be great. For some teenagers a small is too big even. Also, the shirt really smelled strongly of chemicals when we first got it even airing it out didn���������t get the smell out. I hesitated washing it because I knew if that didn���������t get the smell out you wouldn���������t return it. I just feel like I���������m stuck with ",7
Great store. So many amazing artists. Lots of variety of genres. Good quality products. 5 stars!,7
I ordered a shirt and when it came it was very small on me. So I sent you guys and email and it was amazing how quickly you responded. You then sent me a new larger shirt and told me to keep the one that didn't fit. So I got a great fitting shirt and I gave the smaller one to my sister!!,7
Really pleased with the customer service from TeePublic. I had a couple shirts that needed to be replaced and everyone I spoke to was very kind and helpful. The problem was resolved with ease and new shirts were sent to me quickly. I will definitely be back for some more merch in the future.,7

I needed a larger size than ordered.Great and easy service during the exchange.,7

I ordered 3 different colors of Zack Snyder's Justice League 2021 Victory Shirt. The Slate ones is much better and readable than the red and navy shirt. The print needs to be darker and bolder.,7
I'll say I love how unique some of the shirts I found.I love the premium shirts... they're super soft and the quality of the print seems to be very good quality as I've noticed with other companies the print tends to come off within the first few washes and these are legit!I will be a repeat customer for sure and hope that I'm just as stoked about those future purchases as I am with my current!,7
"Great original shirts, i am 100% satisfied!",7
"Service was so slow, I had to cancel order before receiving it as I no longer needed it. Waited three weeks for shipment confirmation and my order never was made or shipped. I asked for my card to be refunded. I hope that doesn't take as long.",7

"Fantastic shirt ! Great Design, shirt runs a little small but still fits . Over all great shirt",7
"I don't know if this was my mistake or in Tee Public, but I ordered two items. The way in which you order it seems you have to pay each order separately, and therefore each shipping charge separately. It would have been nice just to add both items and pay for shipping once. Maybe I missed how to add to my order, so maybe a way to make that more clear.",7
My wife loved this shirt.The size was a little smaller than I am used to ordering but the vendor responded within 24hrs and had us taken care of.We can't thank her enough for all of her help and we will be ordering from here again.,7
The shirts are great but they start to lose the image after like 5 washes. I got two Nicolas cage fighter shirts and you replaced one but now they are barely readable. When i get a shirt i like to know it will become my favorite shirt and not something i will have to rebuy again,7
Nice comfy shirts & delivered quickly !,7
"I LOVE the designs, but the T-shirts were just scrunched up in a bag and some of the printing stuck together. I had to gently pull it apart and on one T-shirt, the images stuck to each other and tore.All you have to do is put a little tissue paper or wax paper to protect the printing on the shirts and save the image.",7

"I ordered on 5/21 and received no confirmation so assumed the order did not go through Until my credit card bill arrived with a 90.90 dollar charge.

I love the crazy variety of items you have available and that you can customize color and style of shirts.Received item very quickly.,7
Tee Shirt material extremely poor quality. Silk Screen poor quality.,7
Was very impressed that TeePublic could process and get an order to me very close to Christmas when Amazon either could not or would not. I was very happy to patronize another smaller company. I was also happy to see a great sale when choosing my shirts. My only disappointment was getting the shirts and realizing the fabric was thinner than expected and seemed cheap. Expected better quality.,7
Love them they gave me some awsome shirts,7

The tee I purchased is very nice. Beautiful design and graphics. The reason I didn't give a 5 star review is the sizing! I normally wear a woman's L ( 12-14)I ordered an XL to be safe from shrinking or slightly small sizing. The tee I received is INSANELY small! Not even a 'medium' size.

The only issue I had was the UPS tracker where the order was supposed to be delivered on January 23rd and I looked at the tracking number and it was near my destination but then went back to Orlando, Florida or California and I didn't get it until January 27th. I would suggest for UPS to properly correct their trackers. I did not mind waiting for my delivery but as a future reminder they should properly let the customer know when their order arrives. Kudos to the independent Artists who created the drawings and made it into a shirt!",7
"TeePublic's tee shirts are very soft and smooth and comfy, unlike the ""heavy duty"" scratchy brands other online t-shirt companies use.They have a lot of colors (but please add a neon lime green and a light orange - kind of a peachy mango) and the half dozen or more designs I've gotten are bright and look good.No issues there!I'm a little disappointed that a follow up email gies me the option to change my order (I got the same design in both red and orange - too similar) but after I go into my order there doesn't seem to be a way to change it- a 'sorry, too late to make changes"" message would be helpful. Also, if there were a number for each design - mine are all VW beetle tees, but when I wanted another and searched for love bug, I got screens full of different designsShipping is very high - shipping promos would be appreciated please.",7

"Order didnt ship until 6 days after order date despite 3 day promise. Also, the standard shipping is through UPS mail innovations and there could be a delay while UPS and USPS ""fight over your package paperwork"", aka, probably lose it for 4 days. I had to call UPS AND USPS and force USPS to fill out a claim form to get them to finally get it to me, 3 days late, which is 2 days past the 10 business day guarantee. TeePublic did make sure to refund my shipping charge since it was late, so there was that plus for all my hassle.",7
"Great material, great quality overall, love it",7
I've ordered two shirts from republic and both work great quality and I received them in a prompt manner.,7
"It came very quickly, a few days before expected! Awesome quality (not the see through thin and thick enough to breathe in). Highly recommended!!! (Ours was a one punch man gray base color shirt)",7
My wife and I love your products. I love the unique prints that I can't find anywhere else... We also love to support the individual artists. We'll be back... ����,7
"Great product!!This was a birthday gift for my husband,he absolutely LOVES it. Great quality, great price and received it quickly! Will definitely keep this company in mind when shopping for Catholic items!",7
A great seller with competitive prices and the very best customer service. The turnaround time on the order was very quick.,7

I love your products......keep them coming!,7
"Your sizing is off, especially with different fabrics.Your customer service is outstanding.We actually got the return faster than the original order.I will most likely order any special T-shirts from you from now on. Thank you for your excellent customer service and (except for sizing) excellent product.",7
The lettering and the printing was perfect on the mug. I'm still waiting for the mask to arrive but I am confident that I will be happy when it arrives.,7
I purchased this as a gift. Shipping was fast and the item was received in good condition.,7
Was looking for a mask and this was perfect. Living in England other veterans have asked including veterans from the States. Fits perfect and easy to breathe through. Will be ordering another design soon.,7
The shirts I ordered looked just like the pictures. They fit perfectly and look so good on!! Hard to find good Murder she wrote tee's and the style reminds me of the series disk covers so cute. The order came on time and I had a sweet message on my package!! Would buy from here again.,7
The letters on the back of phone case where not centered,7
Love the t-shirts I ordered. I recieved them in just under 2 weeks. The material is perfect and better than I thought it would be. I will definitely be ordering more shirts very soon.,7
My nephew received his Titanosaurus tee shirt today and is overjoyed!! heloves it and immediately put it on!! Thank you!!,7
The shirts were exactly as pictured and I loved the design but I was disappointed in the sizing of the shirts. I ordered the same size in both my shirts but the one is extremely big and the other is a little small. I will be able to wear them both but I wish they had been sized appropriately.,7
"Quality produts, love the designs, sizes and options!",7
"they send the wrong items and sizes were off (due to not telling you what brand of tank/t-shirt they were printing on) so they made it right by sending the proper sizes and it was corrected. They need to tell customers if its ""next level"" ""Gildan"" or ""Haines"" because they all have different fits and fabric feel. The Gildan tanks I received were the hardest fabric & worst quality and wont soften in wash, so I would never buy a Gildan tank again.",7
It would be better if the logo was placed higher. The quality of the printing was good.,7
I liked how willing the people I talked to were to help. I even got a free replacement simply because I asked.,7
Shirts were a gift to my husband and he loved the designs. They were a bit small (fitted compared to others) and after contacting customer they offered to get them replaced right away (hassle free service). Will definitely order from them again.,7
Tee shirts look amazing and look like they will last. I will definitively buy again.,7
quality products and unique as well. customer service does their best to insure your product arrived when needed. will be shopping here again.,7
Quality prints on quality material. Quick shipping. I'll definitely be making more purchases and sending friends to TeePublic.,7
The shirts I got were great. Awesome design!,7
"Nice quality, comfortable & good fit.",7
"I ordered four t-shirts, two of which were too small (I had gotten 2 large and 2 medium). After losing 40 pounds this year I wasn't sure what sizes to get so when I tried on the mediums and realized they were too small I reached out through their exchange option. To my surprise they not only agreed to ship me out the same two shirts in large - they didn't even require me to send back the brand new mediums and encouraged me to donate them or do whatever I saw fit with them. I will definitely be ordering from TeePublic again. Also, not only did the items ship quickly; the quality of the shirts for the prices are great! Customer support was also phenomenal with staff getting back to my exchange request within a day.",7
I accidentally bought the wrong size for a gift for my son. I contact them for assistance in returning the shirt. It was so easy and they were so helpful. It was an completed in a few minutes. They were very pleasant to talk to. Way more then you would expect any service to be. Just amazing.,7
I ordered new face masks because I was tired of the same old plain ones. My new masks are awesome.,7

Excellent art work and service. Love the t shirt!,7
"Great quality tees at affordable prices. Wide array of sizes, even extended sizes for us larger folks. I'd have given a 5 star review if only they offered but big AND tall sizes. I've had several of the designs offered for years and they are still as bright and clear as the day they arrived. There's been no lifting or peeling of the transfer. Absolutely cannot recommend then enough!",7

Appreciate the timely response and shipment.Faster delivery is the only problem,7
I had a bad experience with local postoffice losing or not delivering my order but after calling TeePublic they made it right.I really appreciate the quick response and turnaround on my order.,7
Product was as advertised and was delivered timely.,7
Plenty of communication.Wish they had a larger version of the coffee cup/mug,7
Done and done with this company. Poor quality clothing. Cheap for a reason.,7

The print could have been darker but overall from ordering to shipping to delivery I'd say I had a good experience.,7
Men���������s T-shirt was great. Unfortunately the sizing on the women���������s is HORRIBLE.Way to small. I���������d say you���������d need to size up at least t,7

"Great design, fast delivery and very happy to help artists,",7
"Shirts delivered quickly. The order, complete & correct colors. I am excited to give themAs a gift before our Cushman meet.",7
Reliable as always - shipping to Australia takes quite long for the products to arrive,7
T shirts are super comfy. The designs aren't cheaply put on and look clean. Just as pictured on the internet. Shipping and receiving it was as easy as Amazon prime.,7
It's a Christmas present. I'm sure he is going to like.,7
I paid extra to have my merchandise by a certain d date. That date was not met. They also sent me the wrong merchandise. They do not respond to emails in a timely fashion. My issue remains unresolved. It's a dishonest company that I'll end up reporting to my credit card company as being being fraudulent.,7

They cancelled the second order right away.The shirts are very good quality, the prints are excellent. I'm very happy with my experience. TeePublic is now my ""go to.""",7

"After my first washing of my garments following care instructions, the graphic melted off of 2 of my shirts. They are great designs and looked good initially, but they should not fall apart after one wash. I won't shop here again.",7
I bought 2 sweaters that were the same brand and size. They both fit different. One is a bit too small. The other is perfect. The one that fits perfect has faded printing. So it's bright on one side and washed out on the other. I like both of the concepts but they just didn't hit the mark for the price.,7
My Camaro t-shirt turned out great!The cotton feel of it was softer thanI expected.,7

"In December, 2021, I ordered five shirts from TeePublic. Upon arrival, four of the five shirts had crooked/off center/uneven graphics. I contacted TP to report the problem. After providing photos of the defective shirts, TP sent replacements for them. Three of four of the the second batch of shirts were just as bad as the first round. I contacted TP to complain. Again, they asked for photos. I replied by asking if I could expect another dose of bad print jobs even if I did send them photos. I do not have the time or patience to ride the bad shirt carousel on perpetual repeat. They avoided my question altogether and just told me to send pictures, AGAIN. Call me crazy, but I should be able to order shirts from a T SHIRT COMPANY and expect to receive the product(s) as advertised, without having to explain why their products suck. I paid $20/each for these five shirts. Only two of them are wearable, which puts me out $60 almost one month later. I am done. Stay away from TeePublic.",7
Printing is great.The t-shirts are good quality.,7
"Perfect size, super fast delivery!",7
The t shirts I ordered arrived in a timely fashion and were sized and decorated exactly as depicted. I will order from them again.,7
"I saw the Save Palestine t-shirt I bought from you on another website and bought it before I knew about TeePublic. The manager of my grocery store in NYC is from Palestine. I showed it to him and he cried with happiness. He asked if I could order him one. The site no longer carried it. I searched the Internet and found your site and lo and behold you had it! I ordered it in an XL and it arrived a few days after I ordered it. I took it to him at the store and he was beside himself with happiness. Such an incredibly beautiful and powerful t-shirt. I wish I knew the artists name!I put your company name on the hanger so he could order additional shirts, which I am certain he will. There is a large Palestinian community in NYC believe it or not. I lived with the Palestinians in 1970 as a 20-something. It was a life-changing experience I will never forget. Now, as I approach my 80th birthday, these memories become stronger not weaker.Thank you TeePublic for carrying this wonderful t-shirtPlease tell the artist who created it he/she has brought untold happiness to a lot of people.God bless you.Anna V. Carroll NYC",7

The t-shirt is good quality and the fit is about right. Definitely order one size up. The product shipped quickly and I was provided a tracking number.,7
I'm almost sad I found this place because I really could drop a wad of cash here. Need an A-Team hoodie? They've got it! Your 80s band concert t-shirts are worn out? Replace them here (or something close to them). So many designs available you're sure to find something you like. I did some early Christmas shopping while the sale was on in July. One t-shirt arrived with the wrong design and teepublic made it right immediately - I was very impressed! I may need to increase my t-shirt/hoodie budget because I want SO MANY things from this site! Fulfillment of the initial order was pretty quick - about what you'd expect. Fulfillment of the replacement order was clearly expedited. THAT'S customer service! I'm happy and will be back!,7
"I ordered 2 adult shirts and 2 youth shirts. The designs were great. The colors of the adult shirts were great.The color of one the youth shirts is terrible. I order white (white and green were the only 2 options in youth size, for this particular design). Its a very dingy dirty white. I'm going to try and dye it a different color. The other youth shirt was gray - that color was fine.",7

The decal is off-centered. I try to ignore it but it's too obvious. I won't be wearing it out of the house. Otherwise I would have loved it.,7

Quality product. Much faster shipping than I anticipated.,7
"The t-shirts are just not good quality. Very weird fit, longer than normal and the material is pretty thin. After just a couple washes lettering is starting to remove on one of the two I ordered. I now feel guilty for buying a shirt from here rather than paying more to get a better quality one from the source of the quote that was on one of the shirts. The other one was unique so I don't mind that. However, with the awkward fit I am not even sure I will keep wearing these. They were supposed to be gym shirts but now they might just be pajama shirts at best.",7
Very comfortable shorts and I love the images. Customer service is wonderful!!!,7

Shirts are great. Ordered for delivery to Canada so shipping took longer than expected,7
The products aren't made in America which is a shame since they have American ships etc on them and this is a disgrace to the military. I probably won't order anything else.,7
Beautiful design. Really love the soundtrack album art and I'm ecstatic it was Incorporated into a beautiful design.,7
Design is as advertised but...- Shirt material is thin- shirt itself is long on the body- I was not able to change shipping option without cancelling and starting the whole process again.,7
I ordered one size bigger than my usual size---and this was still too small---,7
Easy process and a good selection.One suggestion I have is when I did a Google search the design I wanted would show up as a google result. When I searched directly in your store I was not able to find the design I was looking for.,7
Purchased 1 T-shirt and 2 stickers. Shirt is a little small for a Large. I just air dry it... no heat. Love the stickers. Both products are for BLM.,7

"I ordered three t-shirts. The soft t-shirt are a quality I expected. The designs...One is perfect. Looks great. Exactly as expected.One is ok (the logo appears to be worn a little on one side). Not a deal breaker, but I noticed. However, I don't think that is how it is supposed to look. One has the logo crooked. It's not even a complicated design, just a band name. Since I ordered using a nice discount, quality must not have been a concern.This is my first and last time using teepublic.",7

Love the unique items and the quality has always been excellent too.,7
One of the designs on one of the shirts I bought immediately started falling apart. And all my shirts were supposed to be medium but one of the shirts was an XL. They stuffed all 5 shirts into a tiny bag and the shirts designs were creased. I will not be ordering from you again.,7

Cute shirt.Size looks right.The material seem stiff as if too much sizing was put on it.Not sure how it will feel after I wash it. Wish the print colors were just a little bit brighter.,7
They say a picture is worth 1000 words the smiles and expressions that I receive wearing these t-shirts is worth even a lot more great job guys!,7
The printing on the shirts was great.The man's shirt was of very good quality and the sizing is great.The ladies shirts seem to be of a cheaper quality.I ordered two shirts.A medium and an x-large.Both are not true to the size.Next time I will orderll in men's sizes.,7

Love the soft shirt and how fast I got it!! I was disappointed that the black lettering on a navy blue shirt was really hard to see. I wish the lettering had been changed to a color that could have been seen.,7

"My order arrived a day earlier than expected, which was terrific.Quality good, my wife loved it.",7
Everything was great. The only thing I could say is the shirt has a strong ink of chemical smell to it. One wash should take care of it but it was strong enough to be worth mentioning.,7

Company wouldn���������t exchange or refund my shirt that was way too small. I tried to contact them several times. Size 2XL in woman���������s is the size of a regular Women's Medium. These tee shirts are extremely small. Very Poor customer r,7

"Wow I just love the shirt and everyone else that I have shown it to, says it���������s the tops!!Reminds me of ",7
"I have absolutely nothing bad to say about them. Here's what happened.I order a few shirts. They arrived in a timely manner. The materials were excellent. Soft, good print. Tons of designs to choose from. One problem (not their fault), the women's size was smaller than I calculated. Got a hold of them and they straightened it out in under a couple hours. I will totally be getting more stuff here.",7
"The sweatshirt was sent in a box with no plastic, no tags, as if it were a USED sweatshirt. It took forever to get here too.",7
"The designs are so cute but i���������ve had to return 2 defective tshirts. It as done in a very timely fashion though. Then when I received the second/replacement tshirts there was a huge hole in the bag. One of the tshirts was great the other had brown spots along the bottom. I contacted the company and they suggested I wash it, it could be a chemical reaction and washing it might remove the stain. They did say if the stain was still there after that they���������d send me a new one. So this has just been a big hassle, but the shirts are cute, vibrant and lightweight. I actually would order again from this company despite the fiasco beca",7

The graphics were great but the quality of the tee shirt was not good.Very thin.I usually like to get Gildan dry blend.They do not shrink.My son will love the shirt but it probably won t fit him after 1st wash.Might like to return for bigger size.He wears a Med in Gildan or Friut of the Loom.,7

Such great tees! Super fun and original!,7
"Great customer service, fast shipping. They seem pretty committed to cracking down on image theft so I feel pretty comfortable supporting their artists.",7
"Not even 1 star should be received by these people! They are a scam and liars! I placed an order days before Christmas so I was told that my order would arrive before the holiday, and turns out they lied! I even gave them the benefit of the doubt and waited a few days after, my order still hadn't arrived (please keep in mind they sent me an email stating my order had been shipped) so I immediately went on their website to get in contact with these people. It's funny to me how much of a challenge it was to get in contact so I finally sent an email. These people did not reply to my email about my concerns with my order. All they did was send me an email stating they were going to return 1/3 of the money that I had paid for my order. THAT IS COMPLETE BS! Please do not order from these people, they are liars and it is very hard to get in contact when having issues. I will be getting my money back and that's a fact!",7
Amazing shirts and turnaround time. Very happy customer. A++++,7
Not sure if these are kids sizes not women's but they don't fit. I even ordered 2 sizes larger and they are still small.,7

"Wish the search allows for Boolean searches to narrow down to what I was looking for, rather than having to scan through pages of items to find it.",7
"Understanding the realities of shipping priorities changing during the pandemic, I felt as if the approximated ship date the website notified me of was incredibly off-base. One of the T-shirts was printed very poorly, off-center and not straight, and instead of Canceling that item and refunding my money as I requested, the company just ordered a reprint of the same shirt. By the time the shirt arrives I will no longer live at this address. I did not want to volunteer that to The customer service rep, but it has now been a number of days since I made the original request which was ignored. I sent a follow-up email right after she notified me of the re-order, and I still have not received any Further correspondence.",7
The print quality and shirt material was great!,7
Great customer service. Needed bigger size and they responded quickly and new size sent.,7
"I did not know this sweatshirt was made in Pakistan and chances are the material is going to pill.Fabric feels cheap despite not a cheap sweatshirt. The artwork is decent.

I sent an email to the company and still have not heard back.",7

Image is incredibly tilted. Print looks nice. Shirt fits well.,7
Nice print on shirt I ordered a 3xl it's more like a medium. Your premium shirt sucks. Walmart has better quality for 5 bucks. Can imagine what your regular shirt quality is. Please step up your game I hate giving you reviews like this. Yours truly unhappy customer.,7
I got it as a gift for my daughter.She loves the artwork and it's a perfect fit as well. :),7
"We had an issue w our delivery (Lost) and as soon as teepublic were made aware of it, they were all over it.I mentioned the shipping situation and they changed the method for the replacement.

We ordered 4 Wine with Dewine T-shirts.The print quality was not good on two of them. The shirt showed through the print and it wasn'ton all shirts or in the same place.The print did not have clean crisp edges. The print seemed to be smudged along the edges.,7

I bought a 2x because it was suggested to size up at least 1 size. I���������m a large. It was so huge it came to my knees. Bought a second one in large. Way too tight. Bought a THIRD shirt in xl and it fits exactly the same way as the large. Absolutely ridiculous. I will never shop here again which is sad because their prints are adorable and the shirts are sof,7
Everything I order was awesome. Somethings are Christmas gifts. So I just hope they will love there gifts.,7
Order was all wrong image was printed on the back not the front and sizes were children sizes not adults when specifically specified adult,7
"Great selection, designs, fast service!",7
The t-shirt design is fantastic.The delivery period was a bit long.,7

Killer Artwork. Love this hoodie too much!,7
"Weird discount system to incentive people on buying ASAPBut initial impressions are good, no issues with the website.",7
Loved it. The image looks great. Correct size.,7
Great designs. Shipping time is decent,7
"I was pleased with the service I received. I placed an order and one of the shirts I purchased wound up arriving with a poor quality print (no fault of TeePublic, just the image the user uploaded was low quality). I was offered any other shirt in any other style and color on the website. I think I wound up not getting the color I requested, but it may have just been unavailable. The color of the replacement shirt is a color I like, so it wasn't a big deal. I'm sorry I didn't look a little more closely at the quality of the design on the original shirt, but I appreciate TeePublic making good on their word to replace an item I was not satisfied with, even if it wasn't something they themselves were responsible for.",7
These are very nice t-shirts. They are soft and well made. The graphics are great. They do fade after a lot of washing but so do most graphic t shirts. The selection of designs available from this company are phenomenal. My son is a video gamer and I have found everything he has requested to be available through this company.,7

"The pictures on the masks are great, however the mask themselves are not. Ear loops were baggy but can be stiched. The worst part is the covering itself it is not wide enough to properly cover nose & mouth like it should be. The height from nose to chin needs to be increased. They barely even fit my 6 year old.",7

"I ordered a coffee cup. It hadn't arrived after 10 days and tracking info only said it had been sent to its first DHL location. I called DHL; they said to call the company because this couldn't be right. I contacted TeePublic; they quickly sent another coffee cup. Next thing you know, my first order arrived (11 days after ordering it). It is one of those small cups (shouldn't be called a ""mug"") no one uses anymore, and the image is only on one side, and it's on the side where a right-handed drinker would not be able to see it, when drinking! TeePublic, you should offer this mug in a larger, realistic size, and put the image on both sides. And get it together when it comes to shipping. Oh--I got the second one today. Two mugs, both mediocre. So silly. Oh well, now my friend can have twice the laughs. Long story short, pretty disappointing all the way around.",7

I've purchased from TeePublcseveral times. And each shirt is unique and made by random artists. What I like about TeePublc is you choose your design and the color of your shirt. They offer large sized shirts too. The design that you choose the artist gets paid. Delivery is very quick and you can purchase in your home.Makes wonderful gifts or something for yourself!,7

Quick and efficient. Good notification and tracking. The daily emails after my packages arrived were unnecessary and a annoying. I don't need daily teminders you are there. Overkill.I have purchased from TeePublic twice (so far) and a person I referred has done so also.,7

Good stuff! High quality! Comfy too!,7
"The designs are great, if you find one you're looking for. However, the sizing of the tshirts is not consistent or accurate.

Loved the tee-shirts.Good selection of vintage style images and the fabric is soft.The only comment I have is that the sizes seem to run a little small but it could be that I am running a little large because of Covid weight.,7
"I ordered 4 shirts for my family for our son's upcoming third birthday party. XL men's for my husband who is 5'10"" weighs about 250 lbs and it was a little tighter than he usually prefers but still fit him. I got myself an XL women's fit and i am 5'4"" and weigh 170 and it fit as well but I probably could have gone up a size as well. The 2t and 4t for my almost 18 month old daughter is perfect and so is the 4t for my soon to be 3 year old son.",7

The delivery was quick and they kept me updated which I appreciated. I didn't have the issue of ordering something and not getting what I ordered. They seem to have a very large variety of products which I love. It was a great experience all around and I think I will be ordering a lot more form them in the future.,7
"I ordered 2 tee shirts, L and XL for my daughter. They said to size up and I'm glad I did. There was quite a difference in the two. After washing the large (don't know about the XL) it shrank quite a bit even though it said cold wash, tumble dry",7

Shirt was just as expected and looks great. Waiting to see if it shrinks but I ordered up just in case.,7
I ordered 3 t-shirts. One of the shirts was too small. I emailed TeePublic asking what I could do. They asked what new size and color I wanted and promptly sent off a larger shirt. They sent a msg stating to donate the shirt that was too small for me. The other t shirts fit perfectly. Definitely will do business again with TeePublic!,7
The sizes run very much to the small side.,7
I love it!!! Definitely order larger than you think!!,7
Ridiculously poor quality. My first and last purchase.,7
"I ordered a shirt in the midst of the pandemic. There was a shipping challenge getting it to Canada, but once TeePublic learned that the original order did not arrive, they reprocessed it and I soon had shirt in hand. Great customer follow-up.",7

I love theodd1sout so much I think this will be a great phone case,7
The selection of designs are fantastic! So far I have always found so many great shirts. The shirt quality is vary good and they run true to size. The delivery time is fast and always correct to the order. I will continue to purchase tshirts from TeePublic!,7

"I ordered the ""heavy"" (more expensive) T-shirts for my family and they were quite thin. I expected more of a ""beefy T"" but they were more like the dollar general. The graphics seemed nice but I have not washed them. First time for TeePublic and sadly the last.",7
"Shirt looks great! Good quality too. Very happy with purchase. FYI shirt looks true to size, if anything maybe slightly on the bigger side",7
"The quality of the shirts was poor and it took longer to receive.I will gladly pay the difference and order from my usual companies.If these shirts are normally 30-35 per cent more, that makes them doubly bad.",7
"My son wanted a Technoblade hoodie. We researched which size to order to make sure it would fit him. When my son received the hoodie, it was an adult L instead of a youth L.

It made it to me in time and it was exactly what I ordered.,7

I was delivered a quality shirt at a reasonable price.,7
The shirts arrived on time and I couldn't be happier.,7
"I received one order that was completely wrong and on top of that, you shut down my husband's store on TeePublic with zero explanation. He has repeatedly contacted you to try and find out why his store was shut down but you have not responded at all. Also, I ordered two shirts from his store before it was shut down but in the time between placing the order and you shutting down his store, he never received the payment for the two shirts I ordered. So you not only took his money from an order his store received, you also shut down his store with zero explanation.",7
I ordered a large womens and the shirt looks like a large child size,7
Received my order within days!Loved the color(asphalt) and the teeShirt quality.Unfortunately it was a bit small and I asked for en exchange.TeePublic responded right away and I am now waiting for my replacement.,7

I've had nothing but good experiences dealing with this company I need it to exchange my product for a different size and color and there was absolutely no hassle in that whatsoever I appreciate that,7
I really like the t-shirt that I bought. The other two haven't arrived yet. I feel you should think about a different shipping company though. Maybe regular UPS or USPS. The UPS mail innovations is slow. I have had issues with this part of UPS before.,7

The instances where replacement items were needed, I only had to take a photo of what was wrong with it to send and customer service got a replacement out to me the next day. The other downside of this company is the expensive shipping - many times I can't take advantage of a sale because it just takes away the shipping cost.I'm a teacher on a budget so I can't afford it most times. But for when I can, it's a treat.",7

I ordered a couple different designs and received my order in less than a week. They were both fantastic and perfectly printed. I was impressed with the feel of the T'shirts as well. I ordered a regular and a super soft and even the regular one was softer than I expected (in a good way) You've been officially bookmarked!,7
The Shipping time was short and the product was amazing!,7
Speed and Quality was satisfactory however Tee shirt placementlow/ very poor. Not happy with the final result.,7
The design was fine.The actual tee shirt you put the design on is probably the worst shirt I've ever owned.For $20+ what you're charging the t-shirts need to be better quality.Don't put a cool design on a 50 cent shirt or you'll end up with 1 star rating across the board.,7

I love my t-shirts!I really like how this supports artists around the world.My wife is horrified I found this site; she said I have too many t-shirts 20 purchases ago. ����,7
The mask material is so nice and breathable! The patterns are fantastic. The only drawback is that there is no nose support to hold the mask up. It needs a small wire sewn into the nose area.,7
"Almost everything about the hoodie I ordered was fine.BUT, there was a period at the end of the statement on my shirt.The ink on the period was weirdly lots lighter than the rest of the text, so instead of looking like a period, it looked like I spilled something on my shirt.:)Haha!bummer.",7
"Their prints are always perfect. And if it's not they replace the product immediately with zero hassle. That is why I continue to buy from TeePublic. They have the best designs on the market and much more options than any other T-shirt site. Plus, there's a ton of colors and both regular cotton tees and heather tees available. The image is always sharp (unless it's ""vintage"" and intended to be fuzzy) and they hold up to multiple washes and regular wearing. Put it this way; I'm disabled and live on a fixed income. I wear mainly comfort clothes. My humorous tshirts are a great ice breaker at the doctor's office. I've yet to have a visit to the doctors office (or dispensary, funny enough) without getting a compliment on my TeePublic T-shirt. That's fantastic because the nurses always remember Tshirt Guy if they don't know me by name. Your money is well spent at TeePublic.*I bought at least 5 Heather tshirts from TeePublic before I was willing to try their regular cotton tshirts because the heather is SO soft and doesn't shrink with multiple washes. Heather is a cotton/poly blend so the color stays sharp, too. I didn't try the regular cotton tshirts until it was the only option I had in the design available. I should have trusted them long ago! The standard cotton tshirts are SUPER soft and comfortable. I don't know if they will hold up as well as the heather but I'm willing to bet they will. So willing that I bought 2 other cotton tshirts. If I had one complaint about #TeePublic it would be that they only offer orange tshirts on standard cotton and not heather tshirts. But, more that I know how fantastic the cotton shirts are I will no longer hesitate to pick based on color instead of fabric choice.**Also, I'm 6' and 185lbs. I'm tall but not wide in the midsection. I often choose 2XL tshirts because of the length but, unfortunately, they tent out a lot in the torso and can look overly big even though the length is right. I do not have this problem on TeePublic. A 2XL fits fantastic, is very comfortable and has a little give on the off chance it shrinks a little over time.",7
"My shirt shipped right away, super quick delivery to California. TeePublic was great at keeping me updated on the status via email.",7
"The womens t shirts are not even close to size but when I contacted them, they exchanged my t shirts for free. The designs are great and not available elsewhere",7

Great shirts at great prices! Tons of cool designs...,7
While I like the graphics the images make the masks look like they are the regular cotton ones without the pleats in them. I am not a fan of the pleated ones I feel like they are too large for my face so it has made the masks a little awkward. Just with the jpeg showing the item was more true to what the item is.,7

I gave 2 stars for 2 reasons. 1. The shipping took longer then estimated. I ordered it to take with me to go outta town by 4 days. It was delivered the day I left 4 days after it was supposed to be delivered. I would of paid to get it expedited if I knew it would run that far behind. 2. The quality of the sweatshirt was nice. The printing on the subpar. Also I ordered a white sweatshirt and it wasn���������t protected at all. The white sweatshirt was shipped in the shipping bag only. So of course when it was delivered it was raining & there was a hole in the bag. So my white sweatshirt was wet with stains. If the sweatshirt was protected in some type of plastic bag and then placed in the shipping bag I probably wouldn't be wr,7

"The design was cool concept but it took a long time to arrive and then the printing had blurred letters with visible ""shadows"" of each letter offset by about 2 inches. Mechanical issue with the template or what I dont know. But it's clearly an artifact of production that was unintended, and not part of the design itself.",7

I was looking for a tiny gift to put inside of a birthday card.The recipient loves watching Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune.The refrigerator magnets were exactly what I wanted.,7
Update: they finally replied and are taking care of the problem and have been very helpful once contacting me back. I was anxious since my turn around time was short. I will just make sure I double check my order before finalizing on the future. I have tried contacting you with an issue with my order and no one has gotten back to me. Customer service is terrible. Bought a shirt for my daughter's birthday that is coming soon and probably will not be getting now!,7

Very nice product and great customer service.,7
I ordered 4 different onesies in three different orders.The first onesie (first order) was of really nice quality and the printing looked very professional. The second two onesies (second order) were not well done at all.The printing was not of good quality and seemed as though it was only just a slight bit more professional than if I had made them at home with an iron-on decal.I took a chance on another order and the last onesie was adorable again.Very well done.I don���������t know if it���������s hot or miss or if some s,7

"1) Image shown online was a mock-up, and not an actual image of the product. 2) T-shirt material is incredibly thin and seems cheap.3) The application of the ink was skewed. What was supposed to be shaped like a rectangle - was wavy, skewed, and not straight.",7
"good prices and decent selection (fridge magnets).Delivery was a bit slow, but OK.",7
Great!Fast and efficient!,7
"It was cheaply done, almost as if it were a home made print and iron on...shirt was alot smaller than expected. I wear a medium comfortably, but this was about the size of a youth large. And to top it off, i paid extra for shipping, which did fine, but if i knew the shirt was gonna be something that will shrink and become a garage rag, i wouldnt have ordered it and definitely not paid for ups air (for a halloween party). And it smells like chemical unknown. Great concept but overall a horrible execution.will not be buying from here again, no hard feelings but why take a chance, you know?",7
great correction for an ordering error good customer service!,7
The shirts designs are awesome but I was a little disappointed in the printing quality. I thought it would be more vibrant. The colors seemed muted and looks like it will crack on the first wash. But the designs are very cute. My son will love them. Sizes are true to size. He will grow into these for the next few years. Thanks!,7
Im a big fan of any tshirt with funny things on them i found a few and will probably order more in the future as well as the tshirt was very comfortable,7

Every shirt has been fantastic and they offer a wide variety of everything i love,7
"I love the opportunity to find such a huge variety of creations to go on the t-shirts I ordered. Basically almost anything I thought of, existed!The only challenge is choosing just the right product for multiple products and not get the countdown time for when my cart was going to empty--it's pressure and made me order fewer items so I would not lose all the choices I had already spent time ordering. Otherwise, I love TeePublic!",7
Fantasic... I didnt know what to expect when ordering pillows. The quality was way higher and the end product looked way better in person than on the website. Gave them as gifts they were a massive hit. Everyone asked where i got them from. Definitely will be ordering again in the future,7
They are awesome.. Keep up the great job... 2018 blue wave!!!,7
"Too many emails asking for feedback. It's a constant barage clogging up my inbox. I've tried to unsubscribe but you keep sending me emails. Also, ""What went wrong this time?"" Passive aggressive much?",7

So I'm very displeasedwith this website.. i order the sweater as a gift and it was expensive and wasn't even worth it.. will I be ordering from then again!? No!,7

I was very pleased with the items I received. The customer service was above and beyond as well.,7
Scaling options.It would be ideal if we could scale down the designs.Some of the designs/prints are WAY TOO BIG for the front - I would like both items I ordered more if the images were smaller.,7

"I bought some hoodies and Tshirts for myself and the kids. It���������s great, and fun, to be able to choose from so many different graphics. The kids loved being able to choose what interests them. The price is fair, even better than fair. The website is user friendly, easy to navigate. The shipping was great. We received our order much sooner than I had originally thought it would take. The quality of the shirts and hoodies are very nice also. The shirts are a nice soft, breathable material, without being see through. And the hoodies are soft and warm. I�������",7

Great Shirts.Fits nice and great unique design.,7
Great quality shirt and very fun graphics!,7
These tee shirts run awfully small in size.,7

The lettering on my mOTivate shirt is crooked! It moves upward from right to left. Can't/won't wear it.,7
"2 of the shirts are now my favorite...2 others were too small to even wear...there is no consistency in shirt quality and size...the two that were my favorite were very good quality shirts...the other two were cheap and super undersized.Unfortunately, it makes me apprehensive in ordering again or recommending anyone else to buy from you.",7
"The customer support I had from this order is the only thing that I���������m satisfied with about my purchase: I thought I���������d have to convince someone of the clothing issues, but you guys sent out new items incredibly quickly and were very understanding! Everyone was so patient and kind. That said, the printing on the clothes I got was still of a blurry/streaky, inferior quality. I thought this would be resolved with my replacement items, but they look almost identical to the first set of items.I have been purchasing custom printed items like this since probably 2012 from Zazzle, Redbubble, and/or Society6 and have never been so disappointed with the quality of the printed items I bought. I still have Zazzle items from back then that have much more saturated, clear printing than the ones I received from teepublic...almost 10 years later. I also ordered stickers that never arrived. I can���������t fault teepublic for something lost in the mail, but  service team is absolutely wonderful, I will not be purchasing from teepublic again.",7

"Design is awesome,of course, and seems well applied. I purchased a 2xl in order to have a very roomy sleep shirt. It's a very snug fit. I'm unhappy that I don't have a sleep shirt. The cut will require that I wear another shirt underneath. Sadly, this won't see much wear.",7
The quality and design of the T-shirt I ordered was great!,7
"Bought a total of 5 shirts for Christmas. All of them arrived in time. Unfortunately, one shirt was bought in an incorrect size and it was incredibly easy to get a replacement.",7
"Each time I order from Tee Public the quality of the shirts is worse. This last time, the fabric of the shirts was (and still is) absurdly thin...not lightweight...just THIN.I'm done.",7
"My order was messed up from the beginning. From the website where I input in 2 ea of 3 tee shirts and by the time it came out and I paid, it only said 1 ea. Communicating with them produced serious delays to fix that problem. When I got the products, 4 of the 6 were the wrong size. Sent them a note. No response. Finally had to send another note. They���������ve now replied. Now let���������s see what",7

Love my new t-shirt. Ordering was a breeze and delivery was timely.,7
"Quality of shirts were poor. Threads were loose, the images were not vibrant as shown in the examples. You could see the shirt through the image and some of them were even cracked through. Shirts felt cheap and sizes were not as expected. Also, the more expensive shirt was a Del Sol brand tee shirt. Where did they get a Del Sol brand tee shirt and does Del Sol know they are using them? Would not purchase again. Gave two stars because at least they came. (Albeit it took FOREVER TO SHIP)",7
My boyfriend loved it!XL was a good fit.,7

Your sizes are way off.I ordered two 2X and I got one marked XXL and the other 2X.The XXL would not fit a normal sized medium person and the 2X wouldn't fit a normal sized large.This also happened before with an order. I wasted my money both times and won't shop at your store again.,7

I wrote Teepublic to express the issue, and within 11 minutes, they submitted a new corrected order, at no charge. AND!! It got here before Christmas,which I was worried it might be late. Excellent customer service, great quality, and corrected an error in minutes. So amazing, highly recommend!!!",7

"The t-shirts are very nicely made, but I needed 2x in women's sizes and they're tiny.An exchange has been offered, but looking at the sizing measurements the men's 2x lists the same measurements as the women's 2x. They are simply too small.",7

I thought the designs I chose turned out great I went with the cheeper option with the base shirt material and the quality is really good only downside for me was the packaging I ordered 10 shirts during the resent sale and they were all in one shipping bag with nothing else they got hot so they were slightly stuck together but I was careful and none were damaged but other than that great quality stuff,7
Original shirt was wrong size and wrong gender but when I wrote to them they immediately sent me another shirt and it fit. They even told me to keep the original shirt. Great customer service and will buy again,7

I love each of my tshirt designs. I especially liked that they are unique. There was only one slight issue with one shirt.

On the flip side, the designs are always bright and colorful, and they have a wonderful array of artists that sell thru them.",7

The shirts look great. My only issues is they are not true to size and run very very small. My Mom weighs 101 pounds and the XL is tight on her.

Luckily these are for Thanksgiving Day only and I will put them up and make pillows out of them after this so it only has to fit for 1 day.,7

The quiality of the tees were very low.Super thin you need to switch to a much thicker and better grade tee. Jerzeys are great.Also your DTG machine rand out of ink the logo was very stripped like a printer running out of ink exactly what happened in my case. Quality control is key.If you do not fix these problems your company will loose repeat customers I know I will not order from your company until these issues are resolved.,7

"My husband surprised me with a shirt, which fit great, so I ordered 4 more that were the same size but different colours. I was very excited when they arrived a little over a week later, but I was disappointed that they did not fit the same. Some of the shirts were tighter and shorter than the others. Also, there were loose threads in the seams at the bottom and in the arm pits. The cost of shipping on orders and returns makes me less likely to order again. I do love the huge selection of art work for the T-shirts. I just wish the fit was more consistent and the actual quality of the shirts was better.",7

The good: Customer service was great in replying to my questions before shipment and very helpful in fixing my issue.The bad: The picture of Hans Gruber was way more dark and noticeable on the site pic than on the actual shirt I received. The shirt pic looked like they forgot to add black to it,7
I'd say the delivery is good and the packaging as well and the shirts are made of good fabric material just that your printer is putting the design on and when it's still wet the shirt is getting folded too soon making the design come off of it's original spot and stick parts of it on another part of the shirt,7

"If you need very expensive floor rug, this is the shop for you. I ordered ""PREMIUM"" t-shirt as a gift to my beloved one and on the day of his birthday I was ashamed of what I presented him. Very thin fabric (as see-through thin, really), very smelly, very poor I don't know what, because it had never laid near ""QUALITY"" in any sense... I feel cheated, paid $30.99 with shipping for this shi*t, it's not worth even a penny of your hard earned money (you better just throw it away to a dust bin, why not). After the 1st wash it get even worse - I did not suspect it could, but it did. The printed design began to faded away. I am so mad at myself I did not read the reviews before the purchase. It was a terrible mistake.",7
Very Nice quality and very comfortable,7
Purchasing their shirts is basically taking a gamble. I wear a size L T-shirt. I ordered a total of nearly 30 T-shirts from them. Half of them did not fit right. I almost felt like women���������s T-shirts. I am heavily considering just returning everything and giving my b,7

Great shirt! Can���������t wait to wear it in public. Really good shippi,7
Would give a 5 but the print is starting to crack on one of the shirts.Overall I have l9ved everything I've ordered from y'all,7
The overall quality of the shirt and the print is far below what was expected.The shirt is a short wide shirt which fits very oddly and the print is a small square set in the center of the shirt but doesn���������t take up enough of the shirt to look intentional.It looks as if the screen print size used is for an infant shirt versus a small child�������,7
I love the shirt I selected. They have a great choice of prints and designs. The sizing is true to how T shirts should fit.,7
"The tee art is beautiful and the colors are perfect so I am happy with that.I gave it only 4 stars because the fit is way off.I usually wear an XL or even an L. I wanted a nice roomy shirt and I knew the cotton would shrink so I ordered a 3XL. However when I tried it on, it was not loose at all in fact was snug! So when it shrinks it will be very tight. So I'm not sure whose idea of a 3XL is but this isn't it. I'm still keeping the tee because it of the art and nice color.",7
I like that I could chose my BRAND of shirt....Made well.Fast shipping.,7
"All the shirts I ordered are good quality and fit well, and the designs are as pictured.",7
"The tee shirt graphics are amazing; they���������re a gift so I don���������t know about the quality of product until after washing. So far, very impressed with graphics",7
"The design is something I was looking for at a more affordable price, and that you were successful at. The quality of the masks were not good. One of the masks has a white line that wraps around it, an edge of the design that need to be covered by the outside edge material. The masks themselves are to flat that they don���������t even properly seal your face from anything, the point of the masks is to feel safe, I wouldn���������t feel safe walking around with the masks on. I might as well not be wearing a mask with the gaps that I have with the mask on. Should do everyone a favor a remove the masks unless you decide to go with a mask that contours to people faces, ie around the nose and cheeks. I will not be purchasing from you again and I will be sure to tell others to stay clear from ",7
Received on time and the quality of the t-shirt and the ink was really great!,7

I will never use your website again. I ordered for the first time the shirt size was extra-large. The shirt I received is probably an extra large child size they refuse to accept returns.,7
"T-shirt looks great, as expected, and arrived even faster than I expected",7
"I ordered five items from TeePublic, two shirts and three masks. The three masks were misrepresented in the pictures on TeePublic���������s web site, and what I received were nowhere close to what TeePublic showed. I respectfully asked for a refund of the purchase price, since it was TeePublic���������s mistake and not mine, and my request was denied by Ioana. She instead offered me 30% off my next order. Why would I want to place another order when 60% of my last order was wrong? TeePublic not standing behind their own products is bad business. I will never order anything else from TeePublic since it appears they refuse to correct their mistakes and care nothing about their customers��������� being satisfied with their products.UPDATE:After refusing to do anything to correct their mistake with my order, TeePublic sent a second email stating that ���������they were sorry to hear about the trouble with my order and that they would love to  contacted them once. They denied my request to do the right thing and correct my order. How many times am I supposed to ask them to send me what I paid for and/or let me return the products they sent wrong and give me a refund?",7
Timely updates on order status from order to delivery completion.,7

I'll definitely be doing business with them again and advise loved ones to do the same!",7

"Quick shipment, nice quality, & made in the ����������",7
"We were really pleased when the t-shirt arrived. It took a while to arrive, but I'd ordered in plenty of time, so not a major issue.My husband wanted to wear it at war game competitions, so although we had it for over 12 months it had not been worn and washed many times. Due to many factors the fault wasn't noticed straight away, but the transfer print was disappearing.I took a photo and emailed it back to the company with an explanation that it was hardly worn and they replied in a very short time saying they would send a replacement straight away.The 4 stars is for fantastic customer service.I'm trusting in them, that the transfer on the replacement will last as it should do...for the life of the shirt.We are really pleased with it, but its not been worn yet. Fit is great, quality of the cotton is good and the print quality is good, providing it lasts this time.I'm sure the first one must have missed a process to fix the transfer.I forgot to mention the words on the front were in good condition just the picture on the back disappeared bit by bit!",7

"The designs appeared to have sparkle but when received, they only have color variations in the lettering. The size is grossly off for the female sizes. Quality is ""average"" at best.

1st order and I placed incorrect sizes for my son.I went ahead and ordered again the tee thinking that I would not be eligible for an exchange.I was offered the exchange and was able to pay it forward with the other tees to someone else since I did not have to return them.I will order again!!!!the quality is amazing..love it on my son.Both Tees look great and the customer service and prompt response exceeded my expectations.,7

"I ordered a high quality shirt 3XL and it fit like an XL. I don't understand why you would sell shirts that way. Ther was a warning, but it fit a size smaller than they said, they say its 2 sizes smaller but more like 3. Its of fine quality and I can't dare hate on an independent business, but maybe I should have ordered a size or so bigger. God bless they get that in order. I really appreciate that they accommodate your needs otherwise.",7

"The t-shirts I purchased arrived on the date promised.Unfortunately, the items run very small.You must order at minimum two sizes larger than you wear depending on the fit you choose.The size guide does suggest this.However, I figured since I wear a medium, ordering an XL was more than appropriate.It was not.The shirts are snug on me.The price was appropriate for the items. I only wish shipping was lest costly.I will order again.",7

"I loved the designs but I disliked the quality and inconsistency of the actual shirt the design is printed on. Sometimes the ""heather"" colored shirts come in a softer blend of cotton so I usually order a smaller size but my last order turned out to be a different type of cotton blend and the shirts I got barely fit as they are now too small based on the fabric.",7
The t-shirt was perfect! My purchase was delivered in a timely manner.,7
The item is great and my wife is so happy. Really appreciate helping out local artist.,7

The shirts were great quality as wel as the actual print on the shirts. The fit was great also.,7
"The printing on the sweatshirt was fine and it's nice to have this option for more design flexibility in college sweatshirts.However, the garments themselves, despite coming from Gildan (a recognizable brand), were of shoddy construction.The sleeve cuffs were twisted and lumpy, and when I inquired about it, customer service agreed that it was a defect and replaced the sweatshirt for free, but with yet another sweatshirt with the same defect.They replaced it with a third one and that did not have the defect, although the cuffs still are not great as the seam that attaches the cuff to the sleeve is misaligned.This could reflect poorly more on Gildan than on TeePublic, although TeePublic should insist on better quality control from its suppliers.TeePublic customer support was good about dealing with the issue, although I'm still surprised that with the detailed description of the defect in the original shirt (including photos), they did not notice that the first replacement had the same defect when sending it.",7
On time delivery and good quality shirt. The design is great!,7

Unfortunately, I'm traveling for the next month or so and the shirt is at home.This break will test my commitment to having the shirt exchanged for a different color that will allow me to see the graphic.",7

"This one if the friendliest bunch of people Ive ever dealt with. When I mess up, they get me through. Great Tees and a great group! The rest should be like this group!",7
The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the t-shirt price $$$.A bit on the high side in my opinion.,7
Great tshirts. Got a couple for my husband and he loves them. Love the images -- huge selection of unusual things,7
the print was a little too thin so the yellow looked odd as it was on a black shirt,7
"What a fantastic experience all around! I ordered two shirts for myself and brother-in-law and I had no problems along the way. First and foremost, the design is outstanding and I'm happy to support freelance artists in their journey of sharing home-brew creativity with the public! Second, I'm very happy with the quality of the shirt and print itself, as it held up nicely in the washer and didn't shrink when briefly thrown in the dryer (I hung dry for most of it and finished the job with the dryer). Lastly, the shipping time was ridiculously quick! I was not expecting to have them as fast as I did! All in all, great experience. I will most certainly be browsing this site again for unique t-shirts!",7

"I love my new hood sweatshirts with Stella Lou design! However, I've ordered several shirts over the last year and the sizing is weird.Being unsure I sized up 3 sizes. I'm glad I did because the bottom band on both style sweat shirts (fluffy and light weight) are extremely narrow, 1/4 the chest width. The band on the 2xl sweatshirt is more narrow than the medium I have and the small my daughter has. It is just weird. Other than that I love the design and the promptness of my order!

"Awesome shirt and TeePublic got it to me quickly! Customer support seems really strong, and I will definitely order again!",7
"The ordering process was quick and easy, and the items were shipped in a timely manner. My only complaint is the misrepresented size of the women's t-shirts. Yes, there is a statement on the order pages about the sizes of the women's t-shirts running small, but that is an understatement. I ordered one size larger on each of the four women's t-shirts, and none of them fit. My daughter normally wears a women's small, so we ordered a medium and it is way too small. It literally looks like it's a t-shirt for a toddler. The men's t-shirts are spot on. Next time I guess I'll just order all men's sized t-shirts. :/",7

Customer service got back super fast. And shirts were delivered quick.,7
I���������m satisfied enough with the design but I wasn���������t expecting the white transfer residue to be all around the outside of the image. I think this image should be applied only to lighter colored shirts so it���������s not so obvious.8-10-19 Update- TeePublic did an outstanding job goi,7

"Great selection of nostalgic prints. The screen printing is perfect and immaculate! This is my 2nd purchase from TeePublic, and never disappointed!",7
"This was my first time shopping at TeePublic and I can honestly say that I will be shopping there again. At first, I was a little skeptical of shopping here because I had never heard about this store so I wasn't sure if it was legit. I was mostly looking for some 90's band shirts that I had not seen around at my go-to store. I was grateful to find the bands and it was cool to see that the band shirts weren't the basic photos/designs that you usually see from the popular/common shirt from that band/singer. They have so many unique different designs created by a variety of artists and if you want to have a shirt design that isn't common, then this store is for you. The material of the shirt is thin (in a good way) and makes it easy to move around. The option for sizes are in a men or women's size and the shirts are 100% cotton. I ordered a XL in a men's size and it fit's great. You also will receive a confirmation message in your email shortly after you make your purchase. I hope this helps!",7
I got my shirt and it looks normal. No complaints,7
A great company to work with. They responded quickly to my questions& even upgraded me for free to the softest t-shirt ever. Thx again.,7
Love love love! Every design I ordered was amazing! I highly recommend and will definitely be ordering again! So excited to show off all the designs I received!,7
The shirt came quickly and is great quality,7
The T-shirts I ordered are not true to size. They are a size or more smaller. A large fits like a med or small. I usually wear a large and a 2xl fits like a large normally would.,7
"The artists are fantastic but the shirts run small. The trump cat woman's medium looks like a kids size. It will never fit my niece, who I bought it for.",7
"Great to deal with, prompt service and good communication.The quality is good also.Be aware though they are small to size. I ordered my usual M but could have gone L.",7
The shirt arrived as advertised and its labeled XXL but it sure looks smaller. If indeed it is 2xl all will be good. Otherwise i wasted my money,7

"With all the negative associated with Corona virus, it was fun to find some humorous and uplifting shirts for my high school senior. The t-shirts are a good fit, quality material, and just what he wanted. The order came just in time for his practice for graduation and he got a lot of positive feedback from his fellow classmates. Looks good, feels good, right price! Thanks!",7

great unique shirts. quality items,7
"Bought quite some shirts from them, the quality is very good for the price, especially when you order at the sale they have every couple of months. Even the regular T-shirts are good(Male), but I love the ""Heather"" ones the most. I just ordered the female Tanktop (premium racerback) for the first time, but I expect same quality. So far my oldest shirt from them is 8 months old and still in use almost every week. Ordered a phone case from them once too, but if you are going to spend that much money, make sure to get the ""Protective"" one, because the ""Slim"" one just seemed a breakable piece of plastic to me. Word of advice though: If you want to fairly support the creators of the art, make sure to keep your eyes open for signs of people that stole art :)",7
"Great design, fast shipping!",7
"The package took what seemed a long time to arrive, over a week.The size was small for what it was listed and the material was extremely cheap and thin.Not at all impressed with the quality.",7

The T-shirt was a lot smaller then the size I wanted but it did say to order larger then you normally wear so I ordered up but shirt is more like a medium then a large! Also the picture on the shirt I ordered was missing some of the painting around the picture which was not on the T-shirt picture I got !

Ordered the wrong size and it was so easy to get a replacement....I was even able to keep the original shirt ordered,7
It took almost a full month for me to get my package. I understand with everything going on it would take some time but a full month is kind of ridiculous.,7
"Great selection of t-shirts to express my many moods, causes, and political beliefs. Good printing of Shirley Chisholm support, and shout out to her and to recognize her run in the Democratic partys' 1972 presidential primary. Can't help but thinking what might have been, had she not been screwed over by her own party. Bernie is not alone.McGovern,was to Shirley, as Clinton was to Bernie. That's why they call it back room politics.",7

"THe Sue bird shirt is so great. Good quality, nice and soft. I am usually a small if looser fit or medium in women's b/c I like them a little loose, not hugging my belly. My friend advised i get an XL because they fit small and it is great. Definitely size up, and size up extra if you prefer shirts that aren't tight. with the rigth much larger size I am super happy with my shirt!",7
Liked the quality of the item and the timely manner it took for the item to arrive to my home,7

Not the greatest quality shirt. but love the design. Also two of the 6 I ordered were sized wrong.They look like they may have been youth shirts. The size was marked as I ordered but they were not right.,7
The prices and design of these T-shirts are quite impressive. The only reason why I wouldn't give 5 stars is because the t-shirts seem a little faded while being new.,7
I was able to exchange a shirt with ease and absolutely NO hassle.Just received it in the mail; fits perfectly - great design.,7

"Horrible delivery, sorry to say! Ordered June 9 -- received a simple flag July 4. AFTER emails, follow-up.",7
"The three shirts arrived quickly. They are perfectly sized and made of good, thick material. One shirt has a very fuzzy and grainy picture, which looks like it was printed on a bad home printer. Another has fuzzy edges to the figures, but the overall coloration is appropriately dense and not at all grainy. The third shirt is perfect, with crisp borders and vibrant colors to the picture. I���������m obviously disappointed in one of the vendors and well pleased with another, so,",7
Design was smaller than expected and the shirt sizing was way too big.,7

The long sleeve tee I ordered is absolutely awesome- I wanted a shirt that would get attention about pulmonary hypertension awareness- and this shirt is perfect. I love the colors- very well made. I will definitely order from here again!,7
It took a couple of tries but when I finally got the product I ordered I loved it! First shirt had some stains on it from the printing process that would not come out. Contacted Teepublic customer service and after sending them a picture of the issue they sent me a new shirt right away. Second shirt was the wrong size (women's large instead of a men's large) so again contacted customer service and had the correct size within a day or two. While it was frustrating being forced to contact CS twice to get the correct order at least the customer service reps were very understanding and quick to try and fix my issues.,7

The shirt looks as advertised however the size of the shirt is way smaller than any other XL shirt I have.

Great and quick service so updating my rating to a 4.,7

"Two different online experiences I spent more than an hour sifting through mostly t-shirts that interested me. If I set my phone down to make something to eat, when I picked up my phone, the shopping cart would be empty. After this happened twice I contacted customer service and they told me to sit on my desktop and browse and shop for what I want through the desktop only. They completely ignored how this doesn't happen with other online shopping experiences. They completely blame the user's device. They also didn't address how the stickers would say $2 but then when I added them to the cart they would all say 2.50.This is the kind of situation that actually needed a solution in two different customer service reps basically told me to eff off. I'm not going to waste anymore time going on this website when their stupid site and the prices do not operate well followed by customer service that is clearly inept in escalating technical issues.I didn't appreciate the whole bait and switch on prices as well. I don't appreciate how I had $100 worth of stickers and t-shirts in my shopping cart that cleared out twice simply because I went to the bathroom or made myself some dinner. And I don't appreciate reporting these to customer service only to get the answer of you can't browse on your phone because it's your phone.Listen B,eBay, Target, etc. D O N T have that glitch. It is a glitch specific to this website and I can see why it perpetuates because when it's reported to whoever they call customer service, there is no actual customer service to be received.If I could leave this place no stars after spending 3 hours between two different shopping experiences and netting nothing, I absolutely would. Neither of the reps escalated the situation and neither one address the fact that their stickers said $2 but went into my cart for 2.50. I had 20 stickers in my cart for a total difference in price of $10. Neither so-called customer service rep touch that one with a 10-ft pole and someone else pushing. If I had to guess they probably outsource their customer service to barely bilingual call center reps. That would make a little bit of sense in terms of getting a couple of bs cookie cutter responses neither of which solved the situation and neither addressed the price discrepancies on their website.Due to the ineptitude of the website working as well as the representatives representing this t-shirt company, it will be a cold day in hell before I go back to the website and expect anything different than what I experienced the first two times.I feel like if you look up in aptitude in the dictionary you would see a picture of this t-shirt company. Thanks.",7

I contacted customer support because there was a smudge in the graphic of the shirt I ordered.

"TeePublic has a lot of great designs -- in fact, they have so many designs that it can be a little overwhelming. And as a large woman, I appreciate that they provide a women's cut T option that comes in larger sizes. So I get to wear fun geeky Ts that actually fit me. My only peeve is that the ""Curvy"" style always seems to come in a very limited set of colors, often four, sometimes less. The site always defaults to the standard men's/unisex T which inevitably has 20 color choices, which kind of rubs in the very limited choices in the style I wear.",7

However, recently I had to go through my entire storefront to correct many errors in design placement, products being turned off, etc. Also, getting fan art approved and not removed is hard.

The TeePublic team was quick to correct this and I appreciate it :)",7

My new Nightmare Theatre shirt is great. The artwork and colors are excellent. Ordering it was easy.

Shipping could have been faster but love the shirt! Great job,7
Simple checkout but took too long to deliver.,7
Shirts looked awesome! The hem on the bottom of the shirt wasn't done well and came undone.,7
Ordering online was good. Arrived quickly. Shirts smelled awful. Logo was perfect.,7

"Love the shirts, got here super quickly. Also I read the sizes run small which is true, was glad I ordered up one.",7
"Delivery time was good. 12 shipping confirmation emails, all identical, 3 were after delivery and delivery confirmation email. The spam alone will make me avoid ordering from teepublic again.",7
The stickers all came an look nice.... The shirt on the other hand looks horrible.... it was double stamped printed an not in the same spot! So the shirt looks like it has a shadow an was very poorly printed! Who ever checked the quality of the shirt an said it was ok to send needs a talking too! Now im suppose to pay for the shipping it back.... pretty sad!,7
"Nicely made tee, arrived quickly.",7
I ordered 3 of the premium t shirts with different graphics on them and in 3 different colors in 4X. I recieved the shirts in less than 1 week. The shirts are exactly what I wanted.

Very polite and dedicated staff.Great quality t-shirts at a great price.,7
Great quality shirt! My daughter loved it! It took a couple of weeks to get it but everything seems to be shipping slow these days so to be expected.,7
"My order was received very quickly, and was exactly what I expected.A high quality, soft, comfortable t shirt, with a really cool graphic.",7
"Highly recommend TeePublic!Great products!Smooth transaction!Great service!Very satisfied in Austin, Texas",7
Excellent prompt customer service!! They did a great job correctinga shipping issue that occurred,7
It's one of the coolest t shirts I've ever had,7
Love the designs and the ability to chose my shipping method. I���������ve been burned by some companies in the past and I don���������t mind putting out a couple extra dollars to ensure my items get to me! ,7
Decent quality shirt and the print looked great,7
The ink looks faded as if it had been washed twenty-five times. First two shirts did not have the same problem.,7
"We ordered the wrong size for my grandson and TeePublic worked with us to get the right size to us by Christmas, and gave us credit for the original shirt that we didn't even have to return.There are now two happy kids with KREW hoodies running around the neighborhood!",7
The tee shirt are beautiful and when I had forgotten to purchase one more tee shirt they not only reimburse me for shipping but made sure that it got here before Christmas good work,7
"Shipment time was fine if you���������re not in a rush. Fabric quality and sizing is great. Design printed okay, but ever so slightly crooked and off-center. Most people would never notice, but I���������m",7
The stickers and t-shirt I ordered arrived quickly and were perfect! I will be ordering again!,7
Excellent stuff!Will probably order in the future,7
"Great design, quality image (coffee mug). The mug itself seems fragile.Would have paid more for a quality mug",7
"Loved it! Fits well, letters haven't faded",7
Awesome service.Not only did they exchange my T-shirts for a bigger size and let me keep the original order.T-shirts are great quality.,7
This shirt is absolutely awesome.I couldn't be happier.,7
Sent me wrong face mask..original order showed correct one that I did order then after they sent different one they changed the picture...pretty sneaky and not cool..no explanation either..called customer service and left messages and no response..will likely not order again either..cheap material and one of them already coming apart but guess they don't care..BOO..,7
Order came very quick and is perfect!,7
My t shirts are beautiful ! Exactly what I hoped they would be !!They came in a timely manner and packaged well. I will buy again !,7
what bothers me about your site some time t-shirts are $13 and then the same t-shirts go to $20.00and backwards.you shall have an appreciationof customers. I have bough more than 10 t-shirts somemost at 20 and then I see them at 13 other days.,7
Most of the shirts are of good quality but a few have faded after 1 wash some have held up really good so it���������s a mixed bag.A lot,7
"I wish there would have been an option for a 4xl TALL.. I love this shirt already, but feel like a couple of washes it will be to short. I played college football and have wide shoulders. This tends to make shirts even shorter than normal.. thank you",7
Great customer service. There were a few printing issues with an order and they fixed it right away.,7
Beautiful soft shirts arrived speedy quick!!!!!,7
"Shipping was fast from halfway across the country, shirt was badass",7
"Package came a little late but since the postal service and everybody was backed up, it was expected. The design looked amazing and my grandmother loved her Christmas gift. Packaging was nice and well protected for the mug. The packaging also was perfect not oversized for a small item.",7
"I love TeePublic. More times than not they offered outstanding customer service by being patient with my requests (I can be unrelenting), professional, convivial and efficient.",7
"They messed up the design of my print, twice. The bottom of it was 10 inches, top was 9.It was supposed to be square...",7
great products. sizes runs a lil bigger. so if you are a medium go for a small. but great company,7
Great prices on substandard printing. Colored shirts are weak and not represented well on the website.,7
"In multiple places their website stated ""Guaranteed before Christmas."" My order was placed on 12/10 however it arrived AFTER Christmas! Be mindful they say guaranteed even when it isn't.",7
Really great experience! Great design!,7
"Teepublic has great customer service! I love the designs and the quality, especially of the long sleeve shirts. The artists do nice work.",7
"Quality was VERY bad. The design was already coming off when I received it, at which point it was too late to send back and am going to give as a gift anyways with apologies for the very poor quality. It is a shirt would not have expected to spend more than $5 on, as I think the design will come off almost completely after the 1st wash, even following the care instructions completely.",7
Fast shipping and great product. I���������ll be buying m,7
"@Saudade has a new fan in me. Their designs are effortlessly cool and offer a quietly brilliant spin to the band tee. Print quality was a pleasant surprise too, nice and thin.",7
Ive ordered two items now and both have been not of very good quality material. Two shirts from two different orders and artists have been very thin and not very wearable.,7
i love teepublic. i order constantly. delivery was slow the first time or two but now seems like my orders arrive in no time. i recommend to people all the time,7
"Really happy about all the clothes I've ordered! Unfortunately one design was not printed as shown in the preview and a bit of text and shapes are missing. Nevertheless, would order again and can highly recommend. Cheers!",7
"The letter were really big, on the website it showed the letters being a lot smaller. When i got it in the mail the lettering was huge! Overall great material and super soft. :)",7
"Product seems good, customer service was great!",7
"We ordered the wrong size, and TeePublic was wonderful in getting us a new shirt in the correct size and suggesting that we keep and/or donate the original shirt.Awesome customer service and we will definitely order again in the future.",7
"The quality of the designs on excellent fabric is very hard to find. I consistently find specialty designs that are outstanding for the varied interests of my family. Great art on great things, keep up the good work!",7
My T-shirt came in the mail faster than I expected.Th style and quality are great!,7
The print is great also the fabric quality and color is up there. Get a couple see for yourself,7
I got them quick and are i like,7
I���������ve ordered just over a dozen tees this past month and I really like them very much. A few arrived with the designs off center or a bit crooked. That���������s my biggest complaint.,7
Love the shirt! Great quality and fit,7
All communication was fast and helpful. Resolution was also very fast and fully resolved the issue.,7
"Everything I received exceeded my expectations and helped make the perfect gifts for Christmas. The only complaint would be the fact that my order was nearly two weeks late and apparently got lost from one of the separate teepublic facilities. They sent out a duplicate of my order and put fast track shipping on it. I received it within 3-4 days, so in time for Christmas. They did not hassle me at all about this issue. Just took care of it. I will definitely consider using teepublic again. The prices are great aswell.",7
"Neat design, exactly what I wanted",7
"I was very excited about getting matching t-shirts for our family Christmas photo.The website lead me to believe it was possible and the ordering went smoothly.The challenge came with ordering from three different size groups.The child sized shirts were of good quality fabric and a nice rich green color.The small adult sized shirts were of a lesser quality fabric and the color was okay, but didn't match the child shirts.The large adult sized shirts were of even lesser quality fabric and the color was different from the other two.",7
"Excellent designs, wonderful service, and very good quality. Very responsive when I had an issue with my order. Fast shipping, too!",7
Great design for my collection of shirts.,7
"Thought I was getting quality artwork but when I received the hoodie I bought for my son, the artwork was blurry. It looked like the artwork could easily rub off with maybe 1 or 2 washees. So basically I just paid $40 for something I could've done myself for half the price.",7
Shirt was nice but very thin material and runs small next size up would��������,7
"Great product, just what I wanted!",7
Good quality shirt. Fit was off. Design was printed off center.,7

Great designs and fabric quality!Follow the sizing charts. They are spot on!,7
"Cool T���������s, better quality than expected, quick delivery and g",7
Got the shirt.Supposedly new but has big purple spot almost in middle of shirt front. Mary Blagg.,7
"A nearly limitless variety of designs you never knew you wanted.I especially liked the extra mile TeePublic went with their sizing chart to show pictures of actual people wearing the various sizes with a caption stating their height and weight.This gave me the confidence I was ordering the correct size for myself.Only downside, the websites search categories are severely lacking.Unless you have a general idea of what you're looking for via the search bar, browsing by categories is nearly impossible.Sometimes you don't know what you want until someone at least narrows it down to some broad categories for you.I hope in future website updates they attempt to improve in this area.",7
"Shipping was quick, and the quality is great. I received so many compliments !!!",7
Did a search of this style shirt. Fast quick and easy to purchase.,7
Ordered an extra large shirt for my mother for Christmas. Spent a decent amount in shipping and the shirt came in looking more like a small.,7
"Shirt arrived quickly and looks good, but I ordered an XL and it looks like a little kids shirt. Won���������t fit. ",7
T-Shirts are great and delivery was far quicker than expected.,7
Easy to order and everything looked great.,7
Great products; great prices; great service.,7
I understand things happen but I was disappointed in a sweatshirt I ordered. The decal ran across the top of the decal with white paint decal and they still shipped it instead of reprinting and making a new one. I have asked for a refund.,7
Umm.... I ordered a women's size xl. And got what looks like it goes on a child.,7
My order came in the time specified and my order was complete and exactly what I wanted.,7
"This site has an amazing selection of t shirts. While I find it hard to choose from the options, once I do, finding an appropriate size is very difficult. I've ordered shirts in an XL that arrive More like a M and women's medium that are cut like a child's t shirt. We end up wearing them as a pajama top or a bathing suit cover up. Love the choices/artwork. Hate the cheap quality/sizing.",7
"I love my new t shirts. The designs are awesome, the size fits me fine. They are wonderful. I shared the firefly design with my firefly gang on FB and they went crazy over it. Hopefully you got some more business over it!! Thanks!",7
Comfortable t even for sleeping.Only minus is I thought there would be a front insignia/artwork and there wasn't - just on the back,7
Prompt service with good status communication.,7
"Very nice product. Nice quality & graphics. Size seems to run a bit small, perhaps...",7
"I bought 3 shirts , two are the same and they are for my best friend and myself to wear at work for our t-shirt day . WKRP was one of our favorite shows . Looking forward to being silly ����",7
Every thing is finethanks,7

Nice quality tee and great print. Easy ordering and reasonable shipping rates to Canada. Excellent!,7
"I bought three. Emo Emu was great and he loves it. It is the color shown and the quality is good. I then got two concert shirts. They were blurry, not great decals and shirt was thin. Very bummed that the concert shirts we plan to wear to the concert, well people will be able to tell we got knock offs.",7
The design is good but the quality of the T-shirts is mediocre to say the least,7
"Good quality materials, looks great",7
Clothing came quickly and fits great.Stickers are really cute.,7
Shirt runs very small. I am a small person and ordered an xlarge and can���������t wear it. W,7

"Great quality T shirts, delivered quickly and sizing issues (my mistake) sorted really well, really quickly",7
"Loved the look of the masks.Unfortunately that's about all I can say that is good about them.The ""lining"" material (that is actually on your skin) is so thin that when you inhale through your nose it causes quite an obstruction. This material conforms to the nose, like tape, which makes breathing more than difficult.The other issue with the masks is that the 2 layers of material are not sewn together on either side.This may be part of the problem with the ""lining"" being inhaled.I also believe that a different type of material should be used for the ""lining"".I was so excited to receive these masks because the 2 I chose (Lucy & Golden Girls) are my favorite shows.I'm hoping to find someone who can rework these masks to make them wearable.",7
I found tees that I had been searching for and thought would be impossible to fine. Excellent quality printing and shirt material. I LOVE my new tees!,7
As always great transaction. Fast and it looks great! I could wish more colour choices in the curvey fit but that's more my problem than theirs. ;),7
Hoodie material was good quality but screenprinting was poor and did not match the photo.In the photo it appeared the screenprinting was black.However it was more transparent and difficult to see on a dark grey hoodie.,7
"Feels like a good material, 50% poly and 50% cotton and the design on is as advertised.",7
Great quality! great service! Love love the sweatshirt which is a gift for Christmas and I know that he will LOVE it as well!,7
Decent quality. will buy again.,7
I ordered three football shirts to wear for my sons senior season. 1 male cut and 2 female cut. The female cut says to order two sizes up because they run small. I took note of that and ordered a 2x. I normally wear a large or xl. When they came in they were still very snug so I personally would suggest going up by three sizes of what you normally wear but I contacted the company and they replaced the female cut shirts with the same print but in a male Xl which fit perfectly at no charge. Very pleased!,7
Very well done sweatshirt and the personalized note it came with was phenomenal,7
"I ordered 2 face masks. They are really cute. The artwork came out well, very clear. The only issue with the masks are that they don't have much shape, so they gap at the top. I'm hoping to somehow make an adjustment to the fit because I really like them.",7
I was skeptical because I'd never heard of the site before but I got my order today and the shirts look great! I will definitely be ordering some other things I had my eye on.,7
"I just received 3 of the 4 tank tops I ordered. The white one you can't see the writing. The material is cheap & the sizing is off, too small. For $23 each the material should be of good quality & the sizing should be correct. Unfortunately I made 1 more order before I got this one. I WON'T be ordering AGAIN.",7
"Had an issue with my order, my customer service email was answered immediately, a replacement was sent the next day, and they allowed me to keep the original order as well. I was left quite satisfied with my customer service experience.",7
I love my shirt! Good quality. Would purchase from again!,7
Quality shirt. Handled quickly with no problems. Would use you again!,7
"No problems, nice shirt.",7
Shirt came with a hole on the shoulder. Highly dissatisfied,7
Great unique shirts. Seems to be good quality. Reasonable shipping time.,7
Have bought many times without any issues. The one time I got a torn shirt they sent a new one (reprint) without any hesitation. Great folks The shirts are also nice and are a better value when on the 35% off sale. None of the prints have failed or washed off so far (some are 2 years old),7
"Colors are true to what you see online, even better in person. Shirts are true to size, feel like they're fitted. Order next size up for a looser feel. Artwork is amazing! I've already recommended to other friends and family",7

Excellent prints and customer service. I once did not receive an order and customer service did not hesitate to resend the order. I am very content with Teepublic and will continue to order from them.,7

"I'm a bum who doesn't care about specific shirts (especially printed word ones), so I wear down my clothes to the ground before likely buying more clothes. That's how I ended up here while looking for new shirts; glad I found this site.I love the Heather material, that cotton blend is nice and soft and the designs are clever.I'm glad these artist have a platform to make clever t-shirts. so I bought a ""He-Man can't jump"" shirt & ""The Critic"" shirt but posing like the super mario 3 box art.

Blutengel is a phenomenal band and it's a pleasure to buy their merchandise from TeePublic.,7
"Design is great, love the t shirt",7
I ordered four t shirts for my daughter and her three girls.The colors are way too bright/dark.They need to be lighter colors.The green one you can read sort of.The blue (royal blue) we can't hardly see the words and picture of the cat.The size 7 wanted a pink one very badly but they were only in the smaller sizes.The M fit tight and that's not what this thirteen year old wants.And I ordered up on the sizes.The heather grey is a L and will probably go to the thirteen year old because it will be too small for the oldest girl.And these girls are NOT big.The 3X is hopefully way bigger than she needs.I don't know what you want on the 2. Rate products.This is my rating I guess.,7
Nice shirt. Was what I expected.,7
I love both shirts so much! Absolutely perfect.,7
"I love the variety of products and supporting independent artists and creators - and I'm always impressed by the quality of the merchandise. Unfortunately, the shipping costs are crazily expensive so it really limits how much and how often I can purchase.",7

Good quality. Exactly what I wanted.,7
Awesome! Looks & feels great! T to B. Top to bottom.,7
"I ordered a 2xl for my boyfriend. He is normally an xl but I wanted to be safe and figured better to have it a little baggier. It came very wide but a little short. Since being washed, it no longer fits length and is big in width. I figured ok, ill try ordering a better quality version. When I looked at the size chart it's the same for all. He is only 6'1 but until a tall is available I guess I won't be ordering.",7
Very good I love the shirt,7
"This is an amazing place to buy t-shirts (and other stuff!) while supporting independent artists! It���������s amazingly diverse and unique, as well as very easy to use. The only thing I would recommend is allowing items to stay in the cart for longer than like nine minutes. That being my only complaint, I still would strongly recomme",7
"Delivery was timely. Quality was good but unfortunately even with measurements listed, both tee shorts were too small.",7
The print is unique and original. My only issue is that the print is not centered on the shirt. It sits off to the side.,7
was a gift and I think all good but account issues - they are now saying I don't have an account or the email address when I get emails from them so that'll be frustrating when I want to place another order.,7
Only half my order came...You owe me $45 plus shipping!,7

"I recently purchased products containing images of two Dr. Strangelove characters that mimic the President Obama HOPE poster. I really love the Dr. Strangelove FLUIDS poster with General Ripper. It���������s the perfect combination of a great concept and skillful execution. It���������s beautifully done. Bravo to the artist and all who are responsible for it. I also like the STRANGE image of Peter Sellers as the Doctor, but the rendering seems unsharp and the image is a bit dark. If these flaws could be corrected, I���������d buy a large po",7

I received my order - exactly as described - promptly and efficient with excellent communication.,7
"Can't wait to wear my new shirt, it looks great and fits great too!",7
Over all the service was great. The only thing was the T-shirt was a classic T. I was thinking it was a real classic cut. You know the loose feel. This Tee was the newer skin tight fit. That is not a classic cut. If I had know that. I would have ordered a 2xl. Real classic cut fit more comfortably than the midlife crisis cut.Other than that it is a great product.,7
So many Great designs to choose from. Great communication. Delivery took a little longer due to the recent storms. I've ordered 6 more shirts already!!,7

Quality products and fast shipping.Awesome and trustworthy company.,7
The shirt was stunning and TeePublic quickly resolved a size issue. Definitely would recommend them.,7
"While the product did eventually arrive, it was TWO MONTHS LATE.TWO. MONTHS. I was promised 7-10 day shipping, not two months! Your website should have a warning on it for slow shipping!

"I absolutely love the hoodie I just got from them, it fits perfectly and it's soft and really hits on all fronts. the only reason I didn't give 5 is because it had an odd odor upon arriving (which is fine, clothes usually do due to the packaging they arrive in) but upon washing the white text on my hoodie turned slightly pink (which is again to be expected but still)Overall, very happy with my purchase",7
"The customer service is excellent and so are the designs.The reason for this rating is that in the past couple of years the quality of the t-shirts has gone way down. Bad quality, bad cuts. Please go back to good quality t-shirts!",7
"We were excited to order the shirts, we used the sizing guide and made the measurements and choose our shirts then waited and extraordinarily long time for them to arrive then when they did they were a size too small. I was also very disappointed in the quality of the printing and they came with a terrible smell. I will not be buying any more shirts from you.",7

The t-shirt is very well made. Nice and thick material. The price is much lower compared to other sites. I was worried it wouldn't get here by Christmas but it was delivered in plenty of time. My 8 year old nephew will love it!,7

Shirt was a big hit with my wife.She has a Newfound and the shirt is exactly like him (Stubborn),7
Nicely printed. Do wish the shirts were better quality of materials.,7
Exactly what I was looking for and was delivered on time!!,7
Shirt decal is dark and can not see detail of the car. Not how it looked on the web site. Was trying to get it replaced before Father's day. Haven't hear any thing else from customer service. Probably won't order again!,7
The size I ordered originally did not fit and the company very politely and efficiently helped me get a replacement. The new size fits well and I am very pleased. I will order from here again.,7
Bought them for a friend they absolutely love them,7
I liked the design and the sender was amazing but the shipping was a very lengthy time frame. Waited about a months time is what it took for it to get delivered.,7
My order arrived the first day of Sukkot. I am so happy with my purchase. Thank you! I can now wear it within the feast day. Chag Sameach!,7
"The selection of products are vast, but navigating them is easy. The quality of the shirts is excellent and the customer service is great. I was recently told that a shirt I wanted was not available. No hassle refund, friendly emails, and fast shipping. What's not to like.",7
"I've gotten shirts here for years, however I've noticed that intricate designs tend to launder off after just a few washes (cold water, hang dry)",7
Fast. Well made.,7

"I ordered face masks for my 5 year old who has one mask that he will wear; I have hand washed every night. He asked for mask with a salmon on it and teepublic was the only place I could find one. I then found masks with all kinds of his interests. I ordered 5 and when he opened them he was thrilled! The fit is perfect and quality is very good.He is almost 6, and I did order up a size, I do think the size range he fell into would have been too small.",7
Consistently great customer service and quality T Shirts dripping with hip factor.,7
The green shamrock t-shirt with the gold trombone is a real hit with my husband! He loves it and enjoys the colour! ����,7
AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE:I was pleasantly surprised to be offered a different size T-shirt when I asked for an exchange and I didn't need to send the first one back!! That's rare and much appreciated!!,7
Love my new PigPen shirt. A+,7
"Terrible so far. First time ordering from here. Ordered 2 of the same shirt. Received BOTH with various stains. One had a light black pen mark on the front. The other had a pea size black mark on front bottom left as well as a fingerprint sized ""coffee"" looking stain right in middle on front. 2 stains on one shirt and one stain on the other. Does anyone look at things before mailing them out to people? Or do we just not care? To boot, when I try to fill out the complaint form, the platform keeps rejecting the photos I try to send to show the stains. I'm trying to upload jpg files like they said and it just keeps saying upload failed, try again. Unbelievable. I'd look elsewhere & save yourself the trouble.",7
Material and sizing are a little off but prints are great,7
"Great design, and good material.I love my new shirt!!",7
Prompt service to correct a slight problem. All handled quickly.,7

Nice to see some of my favorite tv shows and musicians etc... have awesome designs made of them. Most merch I find isn���������t very original so it���������s nice to see indie artists making a living and ,7
Original shirt I ordered didn't fit me well but they sent me a new one that fit perfectly. Very quick and responsive customer support. Would highly recommend their shirts.,7

It didn���������t take long for delivery I believe it came within a week. It���������s true to size ,7
"I've ordered from them before for both myself and my wife. Past orders were good fits. This orderfor my wife was 2 shirts at female XXL size and they are way smaller then the previous shifts that I ordered for her. And I do not see any return or exchange info at the site yet, but I'll have another look.",7
Great customer service. Got to exchange my shirt for the size I needed. Also they sent me a new one when my shirt was stuck in transit.,7

"A horrendous experience, although I'll admit they tried. I ordered a T-shirt I'd been looking for a long time and added two more to make it worthwhile. The first order never arrived. To their credit, after a month, I contacted them and they sent out a new shipment. That one also took weeks to get here but finally arrived. And when I opened the package, I found that tee that I'd always wanted had a hole in the front of it. It had never been worn and now it never will be. All that aggravation I've had with this place means they've lost a potential future customer. I just don't see how they can ever make this right. They tried but they failed. Three times.I have no intention of giving them a fourth chance.",7
Great customer service and quality merchandise.,7
I am thrilled with the T Shirts I ordered!The service was quick and delivery was quick!I will continue to order from Tee Public from now on!Given their name to friends too!Awesome job!,7

Communication throughout the ordering process was great. The design I wanted was spot on. I just wish the T-shirt was a better quality and softer. It is true that you have to size up for the females; I suggest going up 2 sizes.,7

I got a high quality t-shirt at a good price delivered on time. I would definitely recommend TeePublic in the future!,7
I received the tee very quickly. It was in great shape when it arrived. It's soft and the printwork is good. I'm giving it as a Christmas gift to my nephew so I don't know how well it will fit him or hold up to washing. This is my first purchase through TeePublic so I'm hoping he will like it and it fits and wears well.,7

I love your t shirts.They make me nostalgic.I look forward to see more of the vintage type shirts.,7
"Prompt shipping, the shirt was good quality fabric and construction. My sole criticism would be that the design is printed very thinly, but so far I have worn&washed it multiple times and seen no peeling/flaking for the design.",7
I bought this tshirt and after 1 wash it started pealing very cheap,7
"I ordered a shirt on June 3rd to wear for the Super Regional Tournament the weekend of June 11-13. The expected delivery date was June 8-11 (and it noted that this included the expected delays due to Covid). Once I received the tracking info that it had shipped, it sat for FOUR days before finally starting to move. So it didn't even get shipped until the first possible date it could have been delivered. Still, I was hopeful it would arrive by the 11th or even Saturday the 12th. But it did not. It finally arrived on Monday, June 14th. So now I'm out $30 on a $20 shirt that didn't arrive on time and is now completely useless as their season is over and Kopps is no longer be a Razorback.",7
"So many designs to choose from but easy to navigate with search feature. Premium shirts purchased. Great fit, excellent soft quality tshirt and designs look amazing. Washed and no fade noticed.

Great product exceptional customer service,7
"First, the product is just as pictured. The design on the t-shirt is not a low quality iron on sticker. I've already washed it a few times and the design is still perfect. Also the shirt fit perfectly and is a very soft fabric. The decal sticker I ordered is also amazing quality and I have it on my laptop. Shipping was fast and arrived before the ETA.

"Nice quality. Though I was taken aback at how large the presentation is on the FRONT of the shirt, which is not to my liking I just wear it on my back and it is still comfortable.My preference would be the design of the front be placed on the back, reduced in size perhaps to 60% of current size, and on the front breast the ASA lightning/eagle claw insignia alone, the size of actual to perhaps 125% or a tad larger.",7

You are making these shirts up for people like us who are in the monster hobby i dont speak for everyone but i am sure everybody will agree when i say this you did a great job on these shirts,7
"I���������ve been buying and wearing their T shirts for 2 years, and here is what I think:1) Shipping is slow, it took about 16-17 days to arrive Texas.2) The real T-shirts don���������t look as good as online photos. The T-shirts I got have a bit blurry images. If I could upload photos here, I would upload the photos here to show public how it looks.3) T-shirt material is fine. But the T-shirt images will peel off pieces by pieces after 1-2 years of wearing. Bad quality. Conclusion: I agree that they have creative unique T-Shirts. But T-shirt quality is not good. Looks like T shirts for children and teens. I am an adult, so I don���������t ",7

I thought that I had no options due to the customization of the case, but I was wrong. The company stepped up and made things right!",7
"The graphic was missing ink on a part of the image, so the shirt color showed through instead of the correct image color. Delivery was speedy, though.",7
Great quality shirts and fast shipping!! Will definitely buy from again!,7
The integrity of Teepublic has gone down a lot. I ordered my items May 27 and I got it June 14th. This is not the first or second time but this is now the 5th time. The last few times my order has gotten lost. I wish they use a better delivery service. (This even happens with expedite delivery.) Teepublic was my go-to when I wanted to buy something. The quality of the tshirts are not as good as they used to be. They fade now and I only hang dry.,7
The products are affordable and fairly nice quality. It feels better to buy from here than on Amazon or somewhere that doesn't give any of the proceeds to help support indie artists or podcasts. The sizing information provided was extremely helpful and empowered me to select the right size for the type of fit I was looking for. Will probably buy from here again sometime.,7

I was emailed and told the shirts would be printed in 3 business days. This ended up taking 5 business days. I paid extra for expedited shipping which said the product should arrive in 5-8. My product arrived in 11 days and I was constantly getting emails from DHL, their delivery provider, that my package was expected to be delayed. I got these emails once a day for nearly a business week. Again, the quality is great and I love the shirts so far. But shippin and production could have been a lot smoother and faster.",7

Sincerely",7

Always great. Comfortable and wide selection,7
I would give it a 5 based on the actually shirt because it was exactly what I ordered. Great art. The only down fall and the reason for the 4 is the fact that it really did take the max days to get to the destination. It was 5 days late from the day it was supposed to arrive. I got it for a Father���������s Day gift and ordered it early June and it got there early July. So about a month. If you don���������t mind waiting for the shirt then go for it! But if you need it in 2-3 weeks then I would plan ,7

Bought several shirts from an artist we like. Shipping took forever and the quality of the material is not great. Fabric seems a bit thin. Items were on sale so knowing the quality of the material we would never pay full price if we were to order again at all.,7
Very nice job on the art and silkscreen.The size of the graphic was large.It was a Christmas gift for my wife and she loves it. Shipping was fast.,7
"The designs are bright and vibrant but the shirt size I ordered was too small. The immaculate customer service fixed the issue by sending a larger shirt at no extra charge without having to send the first back. What would have been a disaster elsewhere, TeePublic made simple and easy. You can 100% trust when the site says ""Don't love it? Well fix it. For free."" Very satisfied with how it all shook out.",7

"Shirt looks really nice, but it really does run small. Although the website recommends going a size larger I would recommend going up 2 sizes if you like your T-shirt���������s to fit loosely.

4th FABULOUS SHIRT.. love the talent!Customer Service is OUTSTANDING..A++,7
"I emailed a few times already same generic answer. Non of the shirts fit and not even the right size advertised. Even the masks are too tight and too small for adult face. Need to be contacted asap. I will be bringing this to consumer affairs and are scamming people with false advertising on size and bad quality control and charging too much for what other companies that make graphic shirts better 100% quality cotton shirts and nothing like what teepublic sells. They don't answer you well and live chat is useless. Buyer beware I repeat they are a rip off company I learn my lesson. Plus with what they sell and a big company cant afford a better print machine to do clothes. Blurry images, blown up and just really poor. Quality of Chinese knockoff quality.",7

"I am 6'3"" and weigh 165 pounds. My brother is the same build. I ordered a large for him for Christmas. I tried on the shirt, and it doesn't even fit me comfortably.

"Excellent and responsive customer service. My three replacement tees from Large-sized to Extra-Large sized were delivered directly by USPS after I made the request. Their company representative suggested I needn't return the Large-sized tees for replacement, but to donate them to a local shelter.

"The end result (printing) didn't even start to look like your example online.I realize that when printing on black, colors often are not as bright.

Love the t shirtsQuick dispatchExcellent customer service,7
It's a nice design at a fair price but the collar on the shirt already seems stretched out. I am not sure if it is due to the brand of tee or printing process but I am going to throw out or donate the shirt and chalk it up as a loss.,7
"Nice tank top! Perfect fit and exactly what I wanted. Apparently, this is the only lakers logo tank top anywhere?",7
Shirt arrived on time and as advertised. Very professional,7
The only reason I have given four stars instead of five is because this mask was large for my face..I will have to adjust it around the ear hoops.It's like it's made for a man which I am not ! Otherwise I'm really pleased with the quality.Took a long time to arrive but I put that down to covid19 delays.,7
I was so excited to get the She Series-Real Women Version 1 (by KHallion ) graphic on a shirt to inspire my daughter. The graphic looks great on the website.

"Ordered 6 shirts different types/qualities. And they are as described. One shirt came separately and quicker than the rest, it was the only one that was heavy/thicker material. It had that weird factory smell so I was worried they all were going to be like that, I had planned to wear one for my birthday and hate to wash them before I wear them. Shrinkage is a worry of mine with these love handles.... BUT the rest did not! They fit well, the premium feels great. And the designs are high quality,definitely not made is someone's basement like most IG t-shirt sellers. Ordered Sunday night, first shirt came the following Monday. The rest Wednesday. I was notified of the separation in shipments and delay. No biggie, I selected standard shipping.All in all, I will definitely again. Thanks!",7

"I received a t-shirt where the print quality was quite poor, with clear streaking throughout the image.I contacted customer support, and they quickly, without any hassle, sent me a replacement that is much higher quality.There were no hoops to jump through or return of the flawed product required.I have never had a ""return"" process go so smoothly.This is one in a long string of positive customer service experiences I've had with the company, and thankfully, the only time I had a product issue.I'll continue to recommend them to my friends and family!",7

"This was my first time purchasing and the service was great. TeePublic knew there was something wrong with my order, before I was notified by USPS. They reached out and asked if my address was correct and I confirmed, and that is when I received the email from USPS, stating my packaged was refused and was being shipped back to the sender. Long story short the post man ran out of time to deliver and mismarked it, but I ended up receiving my package the next day.

"I've gotten a few shirts from TeePublic.Quality has always been great, and they arrive in a decent time.They have a great selection, and I know I can trust them, so it's an easy no-brainer gift.",7
"Great customer service. I accidentally bought two different styles of the same design and meant to audit which I wanted to keep and the replaced with another design no questions asked. Also, my husband is so excited on his design of Anthony Bourdain and the amazing softness of the style I chose (worth the extra couple bucks). Anyway lots of compliments and we really don't go anywhere to often. It's pretty original he loves it.....as does all my friends and family I bought stickers for!!!",7
First time ordering and i will be ordering again! I love the range of tshirts that you have and the quality of them. I wore one yesterday and got a lot of compliments on it!,7
"I LOVE the designs, but I did not realize the shirts would be Canvas brand shirts. I really hate that brand. These are (in my option) ladies shirts. The fabric and neck hole are not for men. 5 stars for the logos and designs. -5 stars for the crappy brand of shirts. Unfortunately that equals 0 stars. If you ever decide to use quality mens T-shirts I will order again, but I just really hate Canvas brand shirts with giant neck holes and funky feeling fabric.",7

The print quality is excellent and the process was flawless!Payment easy and fast.My deliveries were timely and secure.The service TeePublic provides is great, especially when you are creating the designs yourself. There are many types of items available to print onto, so choice is never an issue. I appreciate the professional service TeePublic provides.",7
What a great design! My son in law loves it.,7
Great experience - had a custom design and I ordered a hoodie and a long sleeve t-shirt with the design.They were perfect.My husband even commented that the design even had the wheels correct on it.The products were a brand name of high quality.The only problem I had was with the tracking of the shipment.Said it was on the way but it took 6 days for it to even show that it had gone beyond the stage of a submitted label.Products were quality.,7

"The shirt was great. I wanted to give 5 stars but it took a month for us to receive it. In a non-COVID world, I would say 5 stars :-)",7
While I am happy with the printing I am only giving 3 stars due to your choice in tee.I've never seen such a thin tee before in my life!,7

"Two weeks ago I purchased over $160.00 worth of items. I ordered a women���������s XL t-shirt and would fit a child. And very poor quality material. Not impressed with the hoodie either.

I also ordered 2 posters that still haven���������t arrived, so I can���������t say on those yet. Needless",7

Mi love my new t-shirts! They are good quality and cute to wear.,7
"The tee shirts were great, but the quality of the sticker printing was not as good as I am used to. There was streaking almost as if it was printed with an inkjet printer so there was variation in the color in stripes throughout. I decided not to put them on my laptop because the quality was too poor. Order the shirts, skip the stickers.",7
"The image on the phone case could look a little better and I thought the phone case would be full black, but it has a little white on the top. That didn���������t show on the product so I would show the top and the sides of the phone case. The quality of the phone ",7

Excellent work. Nice design and material.,7
The T shirt was as shown and the delivery was on time :),7
Nice shirt. Good customer service.,7
"I ordered a shirt over 2 weeks ago.I received a shipment from this company for the wrong product.I immediately contacted them via their contact form to let them know they shipped the wrong product.I submitted the contact form on Friday and Tuesday Stefan reached out to ask me to send pictures of the wrong product.I immediately replied with the pictures and have heard nothing since.They will no longer respond to my emails and have no phone number to contact them.In short, they take your money and have no way to ""effectively"" contact them if they get a simple t-shirt order wrong.Horrible company/",7
The quality of the print was absolutely terrible.I couldn���������t even believe that something this terrible could,7
Material quality is terrible. Not sure if every shirt is the same or not but very unsatisfied with my purchase. My purchase was a Xmas gift so a exchange or return in time was not a option,7
"I love the coffee mugs I got! I'm really into SVTFOE and was thrilled that they had Toffee mugs. I wish they were bigger and that I could change the backround color, even though they are 11oz and I am a big coffee drinker, but overall am satisfied with my purchase. Everything was fine when I opened the box, nothing broken or damadged. I will be coming back for more!",7

Great quality shirt came exactly as pictured. I was surprised how fast it came with the holidays and everything. Will definitely order from here again in the future,7
"Had a good experience ordering two sweaters from TeePublic to support a local artist and to also get some amazing sweaters! I am curious how they work with the artists to sell/produce/send their artwork.The process was pretty straight forward and the promo code worked for both separate orders. I went with ordering the two sweaters separately because they each needed to be shipped to a different address. This is where the discrepancy came in, but it was likely more due to the shipping company themselves. One sweater arrived a day early, while the other arrived a week late. The hiccup seemed to be during the transition from UPS to USPS.In the end we did receive the sweaters and all-in-all a good experience! I would buy again and recommend TeePublic to friends and family!",7
"The first thing I ordered, a black hoodie with a CREEPSHOW design. The hoodie is great but the design printed on it was a rough texture and far too small. I expected a bigger design. The second was a racerback tank top, size 2X, was absolutely NOT true to size. Also, the logo on it wasn't even close to what was expected. This discourages me from ordering again. Do better.",7
Fabric so thin it���������s almost see through. Extra large is definitely not extra large. It doesn���������t fit! A,7
Part of my order still has not arrived (masks).Tshirt came within a reasonable time. There has been no notification or explanation.,7
The shirt looked just as good in person as it did online. Definitely satisfied!,7
"The art is nice and unique but it looks a little faded, like the shirt isn`t new. I don`t think I`ll buy from TeePublic again.",7
I'vepurchased 2 shirts and a mug for my husband. The only itemI received is thep mug. I emailed you guys about the rest of my items and l didn't hear back. I need a support number to talk with someone Asap,7
The shirts that we ordered look nothing like they did online. We ordered shirts with glitter and there is no glitter to be found on the shirt. Not to mention the size of the shirts... they all look like kids larges instead of adult.,7

The best ever����������������������������������,7
"To date, I've ordered 4 tee shirts featuring impressionist paintings.I love the variety of tee shirt images offered by TeePublic and the softness of the cotton fabric.They are true to size and wash very well.After washing and wearing one tee shirt, I discovered that it wasn't sewn properly under the arms.Also, the Cezanne painting shown on it is incorrectly labeled.It reads ""Pot de Gingimbre,"" but it should read ""Pot de Gingembre.""If I had noticed this sooner I would have requested a replacement.",7
I order from them all of the time! Tee public has amazing quality and the most unique designs!!! I buy gifts from them for my loved ones.,7
The shirt I ordered was exactly what I wanted. The color of the shirt and the design look just like the picture. Glad I listened to the advice and went a size bigger than normal. It was just the right size.,7
Delivered as promised! Wearing it as I write this review. Love it!,7
"Shirt was good quality, design was nicely made, price was good and shipping was reasonable.",7
"It's fantastic! The print is nice and bold like a heavy screenprint. And of course, the design is TOO CUTE ������",7
"The length of the sleeves is a bit long for the hoodie. I don't think the measurements of the hoodie was put together correctly. But the design of the character was BIGGER than expected, compared to the tiny print that was shown on the site.",7
"I ordered 2 pins of my cousin's artwork.I received them promptly :-)BUT THE PICTURES WERE OFF CENTER OF THE PIN! I thought the picture would be on the whole circle of the pin, not a square picture squeezed on a round pin...",7
Shipping is a little slow. We got one item sent pretty quickly while the rest of our order hasn���������t shipped yet.I also think the print isn���������t as vibrant as it showed on ,7
Easy site to use. Great selection of designs and very reasonable prices.,7
It's perfect my sister is going to love it it's the right size and fit,7
Beautiful designs. The colours are vibrant and stand out. Now if only I can buy them in the right size ;p,7
"My sweatshirt came so early, is super comfortable, and fits perfectly",7
The T-shirt was represented as a rhinestone shirt. It is not and not true to size. Not at all what I thought it would be,7
First dispatch never came second with tracking did arrive at destination however we waited 2 months for the package but customer service as good and followed up. Apart from the wait was a good experience.,7
Alwaysgreat service and the selection of tees is amazing.,7
Is great selection. Is easy to purchase. Delivery was timely,7
Would be a perfect 5 if the shipping wasnt so high. And maybe the white print to be a little more full,7
"I absolutely love the variety in design. I was brought here from the DCTV Podcast Network, ordered numerous Arrowverse shirts and now I'm ordering designs ranging from Infinity Train and HP Lovecraft. Cheers to the independent artist",7
There were alot of options to choose from like the tshirt type. Likeif u wanted a heavyweight shirt and lot of colours to choose from. Also the sizing chart helped what sizes to choose from and how it would look on a similar build.,7
"Have any designers actually been able to communicate with this company?!I have emailed multiple times when my account was removed for violating Terms and Conditions (which is ridiculous because it was 2 hours old and I'd uploaded one, original, design.)I cannot get any replies to multiple contact requests!Edit:Stephen, did you even READ this review?!I HAVE looked through the Terms and Conditions, I HAVE sent multiple emails to legal, help and whatever other email I could find.I have received ZERO response from TeePublic other than your unhelpful response here!",7
"I have ordered 2 T-Shirts from TeePublic.The first was 6 months ago and the art work was good, however the T-Shirt quality was poor.The short sleeves were extra extra small 4 inches past top of shoulder and the fabric quality was paper thin made in third world country quality.I complained and they sent a replacement T-Shirt of the same quality so I kind of gave up.I really did like the print I had originally purchased, so I decided to try again a few weeks ago and I ordered the Premium Quality T-Shirt with the same art work.I just received the order and again the art work was good, but the T-Shirt quality was dollar store clearance bin quality.I have registered my dissatisfaction again and from here I don`t know where to go.The quality of the shirts are just flat out poor, it`s a shame because the art work is good.So, I did contact the customer service department and the T-Shirt I ordered was replaced with the Heavy Cotton version of the T-Shirt.This version seems to be the better quality version to order and the sleeves are more what a man would wear than what would be appropriate for a female.I am satisfied with the customer service I have received and the heavy cotton T-Shirt is good quality.",7
I loved the tshirts!I will order again!,7
I ordered a few bumper stickers 2 weeks ago it said 3 to 5 days for delivery still have not received anything. It will not let me track the order it keeps going around in circles every time I push track it goes back to the beginning I was given a tracking number but now I can't contact anyone after 2 weeks. So much for 3 to 5 days bumper sticker shouldn't come from China,7
This went well,7
Perfect - just as promised,7
Great communication! Delivered on-time!Loved the t-shirts.......they were exactly as described.......will order from again!!,7
"Fast delivery, quality product and even better ,you carry my size!!",7
Love the options! T-shirt quality varies with print and color but mostly very good.,7
"I'd have rated five stars to teepublic, if not for one thing. I sent them an email about a problem with one shirt weeks ago and haven't heard back. Considering, I've spent close to four hundred dollars in shirts with them, I expected better. The issue was that one shirt out of dozens was the wrong color. Something easily rectified, if they would respond.",7
"Great product,true sizing and fast shipping.",7
Great quirky t shirt and service. ������,7
Both shirts met and exceeded our expectations.,7
Always a great product. The shirts are always what is advertised.Another great transaction.,7
Customer service is awesome! The very best. They answer you right away and are very polite and professional. They quickly take care of any issue you may have making you feel as the most valuable customer they have. I will definitely do business with them again and definitely recommend.,7
The service was professional and well-handled. One of the shirts I ordered had a flaw in the printing but their customer service sent me a replacement promptly at no additional cost.,7

I really enjoy the shirts. The quality is extremely good and the artist design is perfect. Thank you..,7
"I received my shirts, which look great btw���������only they were a size too small. I placed an exchange request and within the same day it was placed and I was notified to keep the original order to give away or donate. Great ",7
Fast response. Cool person to deal with. Sent me a bigger size shirt with no problem when I had an issue with the other shirt I bought cause it was too small,7
I thought i would like the shirts for my hisband and his co workers... They spelt 'electrician' wrong and put a picture of a can opener. I wont buy anything again from here.,7
"Beautiful color printing, nice soft shirts!",7
Great shirt! Fits perfect!,7
Products are very good quality cotton. Colours are likeexpected,7
Love the shirts. Will definitely order more.,7
"While normally I enjoy TeePublic, my last shirt had some quality control issues. Was a standard front screen, but it was done somewhat cheaply, it feels like there is a block on the front. I always get the tri-blend super soft for comfort, but the last screen makes it quite uncomfortable.*Update. They were very nice and fixed the issue and replaced the shirt at no cost or shipping. Very good customer service.",7
I ordered a shirt back on 6/9/20 and still have not received it yet.,7
"Quality is good, print is great.It fits a bit bigger than expected but very happy with my purchase.",7
Easy ordering.Fast shipping.Great product,7
Product was just as described and great quality,7
The size is significantly smaller than it is listed. The material for a sweater is much closer to a thick tee. The graphic is very blurry,7
Sizes are ridiculously small. I have to order up 3 sizes from normal to have a chance of having it fit. I had to give someone a 2XL gift that was still too small - that���������s embarrassing for the recipient as the only size bigger is still not going to fit her. Probably done ordering for anyone else. I may order something for myself in the future because I can estimate,7
"I ordered a lovely t-shirt for my husbands birthday. I got an e-mail on the 5th of April, telling me that my order had been shipped. I never got any information about tracking and the order was delivered today, the 28th of April - 11 days too late for the birthday of my husband. Apart from the long time it took, we liked the item and you should be thanked for that. This did not scare me from doingbusiness with you again :)",7

I am impressed by how quickly my order was processed & recieved.My son loves his new mug & shirt.,7
Awsome t shirt,7
I bought it as a Christmas gift for a friend who is a Shohei Otani fan. It looks great and I hope she likes it!,7
I love my new phone cover.It is very sleek and thin.My favorite is having a Dr. Seuss quote on it.,7
"I loved the designs, but the t-shirts are very long. Too long for us. They go down past the entire hip/butt area. The cut of the T-shirt could be improved.",7
The shirt is too small.The description was misleading .,7
"The print, color, and how it turned out was great, just like the picture. The quality of the material and sizing are what is lacking. The material is very thin for the price and as for the sizing, I am a 4'11"" female 150 lbs. I chose the man style, large, which was ALMOST too tight, in general.I guess this will continue my weight loss journey.",7

Wonderful experience. Great t-shirts. Good quality and the prints look awesome,7
"For we T-shirt wearers, a T-shirt needs to stand up to multiple wears and washes.The material is thin and I doubt will last long.T-shorts the quality that Costco sells (Kirkland) or J.C. Penney's is what I want.I wouldn't reorder this one.",7

The t shirts fit great ! For the price it's a great deal .,7
"My order went very smoothly and the items were delivered days earlier than expected. However, once I removed the shirts out of the package they came in I noticed a strange chemical smell. That smell remained on the shirts for days after they were removed from the packaging (and I tried to air them out). The smell only went away after I washed all the shirts.",7
"For the price I paid for a child���������s sweatshirt, the quality was unimpressive. A simple iron on decal, (albeit a difficult decal to find), was placed off center and had a rather faded appearance. My grandson will still love it though. The company, however, was easy to work with. Orderand shipping went smoothly. My issue is with the quali",7
"The white ink was very light making it difficult to be pleased.Probably won't be legible after the first wash.I am SO sorry, I must have entered this to the wrong merchant. I loved my shirt as will my niece. It was perfect in every way. Once again please except my apology.Dorothy",7
"love the shirts, our group will look great on labor day weekend at the lake!",7
T-shirt is paper thin. I don't suspect it'll last through many washings.,7
"I was really looking forward to this shirt as I loved the design. When it arrived I couldn't believe it. It was blurry and you could barely make out what's in the picture. To add to that, the size is off. I buy that same size shirt all the time as they are usually a little big on me, like I like them. This one was skin tight. And apparently I can't return it as the design on the shirt is specific to me and if I want a different size, they'll have to redo the shirt. Not happy with this at all. 20+ dollars wasted.",7
"Very pleased with my item,Xmas present for my son,he will love it",7

Shirts are awesome. Good quality and arrived quickly!,7
"Service was great, shirts were even better than I expected. They were a gift and recipient was very happy.",7
The artwork on the mug is not complete. The art stops just short of wrapping around the mug and instead has about a quarter inch black bar. I know this is not correct because I have the correct version. I also ordered a mask last year that arrived with a mark in the the artwork. That was replaced quickly.The point here is that there seems to be no quality control prior to sending out your products and that needs to change.,7
Love the products- unique and a great price. Just wish the shipping was also a good value.,7
Fast shipment. Excellent t-shirt,7
"This is the third shirt that I've ordered from TeePublic.I have been pleased with all of the items I ordered.They were silk screened on good quality stock.They were shipped in a timely manner.There were some shipping delays, but that was beyond the vendor's control.They did provide tracking information, so I was able to follow the progress of the delivery.I would definitely use them again.",7
"I bought this shirt for a gift and its perfect, i love it!!!!!",7
I ask for Toyota 4 runner on 2 long sleeve tees and they put jeep Cherokee. They did this last time I ordered and there is not and easy way to get in touch and no phone number .

"For years...years!!!...I have collected funny, offensive, or creative t-shirts.TeePublic has become my (mostly) one stop shop for this purpose.I'm a fat man, and I enjoy a certain thread and size.After some testing, TeePublic has been the only consistent company to carry this type of shirt, and I love it. Your artists are awesome, and the color choices are excellent.I would like to see more color choices on my premium shirt though.Your shipping is also rather slow.I understand that certain things take time, but for $11 in shipping with a 6-8 business day delivery promise... and then receiving my stuff a few days after that...I don't know man.Other than that, the quality and longevity of my t-shirts has been outstanding.Thank you!",7
Their Teepublic guarantee only applies to exchanges for sizing issues. Nothing about quality issues or if the colors are way off.,7

"Great quality, fast delivery!",7
Poor quality shirt. Very thick and itchy,7
"Service was great. Notified along the way to track our items. The only thing was I ordered 2 of two different shirts and though they give you the option of changing our order, I couldn't decrease or increase my quantity, could only delete or add items. That was too complicated for the simple task I wanted to perform. (I wanted to make a quantity 1 and add 1 of a different shirt). However, the shirts I ordered are great. They'll make christmas morning fun!",7
"The tee shirt I orderedwas too small.This company right away mailed me another one and fast.So appreciated !Great company to deal with, great tee shirt.",7

"A completely positive experience with Teepublic, really nothing to complain about whatsoever, items were made and shipped promptly and I was kept in the loop throughout the entire process. I couldn't be happier with the service, and will more than likely order from Teepublic again.",7
"I ordered a hoodie; the first hoodie had been printed too low, so the bottom edge screen overlapped with the pocket. I messaged Customer Service on Friday night and heard from them early Monday morning - they put in a new order/replacement for free, which is great BUT then that hoodie had a messy/blurry print, plus at this point it had been two weeks since I placed my initial order. This time Customer Service offered any item of my choice or a refund; I went with the refund. I've gotten really nice t-shirts as gifts from TeePublic before so I wouldn't discount them entirely but I don't know why they are sending subpar products out.",7

Always quick delivery. Tee shirts last well.,7
This is my third time ordering things always easy order quality T-shirts fast delivery what else can I say,7
Great shirt! Fits well. Fast shipping!,7
"Teepublic's merchandise options are great, and its upload process easy to use. Though the t-shirts designs fade after a couple of years, that's understandable. They pay regularly and fairly.One thing that really annoys me about teepublic is that it is impossible to find my designs or store with a casual search, even if I am typing in the name of the shirt, store or (often very specific) keywords. This means I have to give my customers direct links and makes it difficult to bring in new customers. This is the one factor that stops teepublic being truly great, and is encouraging me to explore other avenues.",7
"The print quality is poor. I don't know if it's an issue with the digital file, or with alignment during the process of printing the shirt. Half of the graphic has fuzzy edges.",7

"There are so many options at Tee Public I always feel like I'm wearing something custom. Shipping can take some time, but that's to be expected with small batch prints like these. What's really impressive about Tee Public is the selection.With so many choices it's easy to stand out with almost any selection you make. Love their plus sizes and love love LOVE supporting independent artists!",7

"Ordering from this company has been nothing but a headache from day one.I ordered 5 hoodies because I liked the unusual designs.The first one arrived so badly damaged you couldn't tell what it was supposed to be.To their credit, they replaced the item.However, when I voiced my concern as to how the other ones would look when they arrived I was assured they would be fine.Well, I received two more a few days later and one of those was damaged.I've yet to receive one item I ordered almost 4 weeks ago and the whole process has been totally frustrating. It seems as though I am back and forth with this company every single day and I still have no resolution.Currently I have 1 replaced hoodie, 1 missing hoodie, 1 damaged hoodie and 2 that are o.k. but I'm afraid to wash them because the designs look like they will come off on the wash.Obviously I will never buy from this company again and suggest that the buyer beware.",7
Great T-shirt with a saying only a few will understand.,7
Shirt is high quality and the print is awsome art work so sweet they did such good tribute to the BURBS. The actor would be proud for there fans to wear.,7

Great quality of shirt and fast delivery. I have very satisfied.,7
Great looking shirts that fit as advertised and came in a reasonable amount of time considering the circumstances we are in.I'll be back!,7
These shirts are the best. The female fit runs a little small so you might want to go up a size and the tri blend is super comfy. The color selection is the best. I wear jesse lonergan's illustrated t-shirts every day to work and I always get comments and people asking me where I get my tees.,7
Ordered before. Great quality. No problems exchanging. True to size . Will order again,7
"I love the shirt... however, the sizing chart is not accurate. I wear a large tee shirt. So, I ordered an extra large to be certain I could wear it.Your extra large was too tight for me to wear it. I am 5'11"" and weigh 200 pounds and your extra large was too small and tight to wear.",7

"TeePublic has an excellent selection (humongous!) of art and options for printing! Great quality shirts and hoodies to choose from to print your designs. We have several and all look and fit great! Cost for the shirts and hoodies are very inexpensive. Shipping costs are reasonable and delivery time is fast, and everything from our orders has arrived in excellent condition! The only issue I had was not finding an XL for their light weight hoodie. This may be simply an inventory shortage, but wasn't sure from the ordering options why it was not available and if it will be in the future. Will return likely many, many, more times to buy products from TeePublic. If you want to find some beautiful artwork and especially those from your favorite geek interests in Sci-Fi and more, we highly recommend them!",7
I was very happy with my shirts. The designs were perfect as pictured on the website. The only thing was the sizing that wasn't quite perfect. The size four looked a little small. The size juvenile seven also looked a little small and I felt the youth and juvenile sizing were a bit confusing.,7
"Delivered and as expected. Maybe if I had realized the circular logo would be a little stretched over the chest I'd have ordered bigger, but that's on me. Tracking my order was easy, higher quality t-shirt was definitely nicer than the base one.",7
We purchased a Grandmasaurus tee shirt in Purple.The actual product is impossible to read on the shirt.The stencil is Black and Pink on a dark purple shirt.The colors should have been White and Pink,7
"The graphic on the t-shirt I ordered looked faced on arrival. It is as if I have owned the shirt for several years. I don't know if this is a printing defect with bad quality control, or if all of their shirts come like this, but I will never order another product from this company again.",7
I ordered 2 coffee mugs which came in perfect condition and perfectly packaged. The artwork was clear and colorful. Took a little long to get to me but worth the wait.,7

To this day, I have not received an apology or any communication from this company, so am hesitant to do business with them in future!",7

T-Shirts are garbage!! you can read a newspaper through them!!! What a waste of money!! I bought XL and they're smaller more like a L. I'm being 100% honest. Go to a dollar store to get the same quality!!I ordered 3 T-shirts and the whole package weighed the same as one of my T-shirts!! Flush your money down the toilet its the same!! I probably just bought T-shirts that have already been returned. It's obvious that this company has all hands on deck in the return division!!! They try to save dollars by buying garbage T-shirts to make up for lost revenues from lost sales because of the quality issues but they're killing this company further where most companies strive for quality this company strives by filling their pockets!!! STAY AWAY!!!!!!GARBAGE!!!!!,7
"One of my shirts was too small, Tee Public sent a replacement free of charge.",7

So initially I was hesitant but I decided to take a chance. The designs are awesome.

I got so many compliments from my shirts that my coworkers wanted the website.,7

I ordered 4 shirts and they are all made of a very comfortable and well fitting material. Unfortunately two of the four prints look nothing like the images on the site. I'm guessing this is due to a copyright issue- (one is an image from the movie Happy Gilmore and the other is an album cover image from The National). The prints are ridiculously bad.

Great selection of designs.Orders are fulfilled and shipped quickly.,7
Absolutely GREAT customer service. Had a problem with my original order and they fixed it super quick!,7
"Great communication,Fast shipping and quality products!",7
Things were OK except their shipping. UPS sucks and tee public should use either FEDEX or USPS. It would be nice if they had a customer service so the customers could talk with a human being. My guess is they don't want the customers to bother them or they just want their money and that is all.,7
"Nice shirts. Quality material and good fit, finish and comfort. Sleeves could be a bit longer, but overall very warm and comfortable.I wish you folks did other hard to find images, ie: Aerolineas Argentinas, TWA, Pan Am, etc. Oh, and the availability of larger sizes like XXXL for Big / Tall and XXL / XXXL Tall sized men.",7
I love the items!! The print on the sweater is a little sticky/rough feeling and I'm worried that it might come off in the wash. I'll just remember to wash it inside out. The fit is perfect. The prints are adorable! Love them.,7

Purple snoopy ice skating hoodie is absolutely perfect!,7
The design art is as advertised by the shirt material is paper thin and gives me pause about shrinkage after a few washes. So my testing is a 3 because the fit is fine... for today but I see what's in the horizon unfortunately based on previous experience. Use better quality shirts and a 5 is earned,7

The t-shirt shipped very fast but the print is poor quality and the colors not at all as bright as what is shown on website. Would not order from them again.,7
So far my purchase has been great no problems....,7
Very nice product; printing is vivid & clothes are good quality.,7
"Your responses to my inquiries were much more prompt & courteous than other vendors.Also your deliveries were very quick, much quicker than anyone else, resulting in more orders that I have placed a few days ago. I am keeping your emails with links to your website to forward to my 15 siblings. They loved the tshirts that I have sent them. (Robertson is my maiden name so the loved that Tshirt)",7
"I got the wrong color shirt.I sent an email about this and, so far, only radio silence.I see another shirt that I want to get but I am now reluctant to buy from this site.",7
"I like this online store and the idea behind it very much. If you can't find something in tee-shirt from, hoody, phone case etc., then there is no hope for you as they literally have thousands of designs and designer to agonize over. The customer service is ok and the quality of their shirts have been the best I've found, BUT even though they are supposed to be ""pre-shrunk"" they still tend to shrink about an inch or more even if cared for properly and the printed parts aren't silk screened and tend to start coming apart after about a year or so of use. Finally I wold suggest a better cart system as it has a count down feature which sucks as there is so much to explore. If you put an item in your cart it can be removed while you are browsing for other items.- A tip for anyone thinking of buying a bunch of shirts. Take notes on the name of the items you are thinking of buying and put them in a virtual note pad and wait before buying. Come back to the store periodically over a month as they have store wide sales somewhere from once or every other month. You'll get some deep discounts with everything at 25-30% off.",7

A very excellent shirt! My dad loves it! Not to mention the quality! Just perfect!,7
My order got stuck in Georgia.When I emailed I received a response within a day.It was wonderful!!,7
It's really cool how there are so many different designs from so many different artists.I wish the layout was cleaner and less cluttered for each page though. It would be nice to see all the products available when you click on a design (on a simple grid or something) so you could see what items are available.The way you have it now (tiny text links at the bottom of the page instead of small images of mugs/notebooks/totes etc..). means that I sometimes missed seeing what was really available.,7

I have purchased many items from tee public and everything have been perfect,7

Love the unique designs - had problem getting an order to go through and received help quickly and a follow up as well.Quick shipping.,7
"Initially I would have given a 5 star rating because they were so cool about replacing the 1st order. I even offered to mail it back at my own expense, but they said no. So I ordered my replacement but the item I got was not what I thought I was getting and now no one is responding to me. It should have been titled specifying that the print looks cracked and old on purpose. So maybe ""vintage font"" or ""cracked print"" or something along those lines. Also, it should have a more clear picture showing the print up close. If you look at the pictures for the item I ordered you would have to zoom in really close or already know it was there to notice the condition of the print. There's a 2nd pic that shows the print a little closer but because the watermark looking symbols all over it you wouldn't notice the print being any different from a regular printed shirt. Now I have a brand new shirt that looks like I've been drying it on high for many years. Not what I wanted.",7
"You have to hear me out!!! I had ordered a tee shirt a few weeks before Christmas and what I got was terrible. The wrong size and color! I was so upset!! I reached out saying I was unhappy about everything!! The size, color and even the type of material used. I quickly got a response saying they were sorry and asked how they could fix the problem. I complained about everything so they sent me a new shirt. Not only did they send me a new one with a size chart so I could get the right size but they also sent it in the right color. And what I got was perfect! The woman I spoke to didn���������t even make me feel stupid when she told me I had received the color I actually ordered. Turns out they did a great job from the get go and the mistakes were all my fault. I even got to keep the original one. To add some icing to this wonderful experience they sent me the new one with overnight shipping so I got it in time for Christmas! My sister will be just as happy with the shirt as I am with the great!",7

Looks good.Keep it up.,7
The shirt was exactly what i ordered.The shirt fit well and was good quality.,7
"I love the shirts I got from here!! They fit perfectly! The thing Teepublic has over the competition is that they show real women modeling the different types of shirts in all of the sizes, plus they show the models' heights and weights, so you really know how that shirt will fit!! It's the BEST way to sell tshirts! Those models, who I assume are employees there, all deserve kudos and raises!!! I will absolutely shop here again!!!!",7
The shirt looked great and had a hard to find theme that my teen loves. Hugely successful gift. Better quality shirt material than I expected for the low price.,7

Nice work on the t shirts. Ordered during covid and i got my shirts on a reasonable amount of time. Very satisfied,7
"TeePublic are great for getting something distinctive, rather than run of the mill plain tees.I particularly like the v-neck tees, the material is good quality, the printing quality is first class, one minor gripe is the XL size is a bit tight and the XXL is too baggy......but overall I'm very happy with my collection.",7

Easy ordering and fast shipping. Huge selection of obscure designs. High quality,7
The size of the tshirt was great but the picture online looked like better quality then the tshirt I got. The picture on the tshirt was a bit blurry and the tshirt fabric was cheaper than expected for the price. Not worth the $20 for 1 tshirts in my opinion.,7

Received productSeemed a little thinner and cheaply made that I was expecting,7

Love the shirts great value. But disappointed with the stickers and coffee cup bought. 7 dollar for shipping on 8 stickers put in a envelope with 50 cent stamp RIP OFF never again spent more on postage than 4 stickers I bought never again. Shirts on the other hand AWESOME,7

"I ordered an XL Male shirt.I always buy XL shirts.Whether it's a sport Tee or a dress shirt, I always wear XL.This shirt is far too small for me to wear.It looks like a woman's large or child's XL.There is no man that wears a standard XL that could wear this shirt.It's useless to me.I wasted my money.",7

Good shirt. I am glad you made an Assassination Classroom shirt.,7
"The T-Shirt is awesome. It came in a timely fashion. My only critique is that after all was said and done it was rather expensive at $42.00 Canadian. I chose the cheapest shipping option, but at that price I can't see myself buying very many more T-Shirts from you.",7
Great tees at a great price. I look all over for tees and keep coming back here to order.,7
Shirt looks great but it appears to run on the small side.,7
T shirt quality and printing are poor,7

"I always have a great experience with TEEPUBLIC.I get compliments on my t-shirts from you, every time I wear them! And have given them as gifts and they are received with great excitement!",7
"Exactly what I expected, good quality print and fabric.",7
"The quality of your screen printing and shirt fabric in general seems to have shifted as of late. In the sense that it used to be much better,your prints come in the mail with this odd odor now, and the shirts have drastically different fits now. I love the designs and options for other products, I just wish you could have retained previous quality of shirt from before the redbubble merger.",7
I choose the better quality shirts and am very pleased with what I received.I am also impressed by the quality of the images and print quality.My only hesitation in giving 5 stars is that one image was printed lower on the shirt.The placement is low enough that it looks a little bit odd and will interfere with tucking it in. I ordered 5 shirts and this is the only issue with any of them.,7
Great product! Super fast shipping!,7

"So bought some shirts for my dad and mum. My dad's shirts were great but my mums (Medium female tri-blend) were too small. The customer service people were quick and efficient in getting some Large replacments, but even those were too small! My mum is thin! So I sent pics of the shirts with measurements and the lovely customer service people were quick to rectify the situation. The XL fit and my mum is very happy.Negatives/room for improvement: So shipping raises drastically if they don't have the prints in australia ready. While this is fine, maybe a toggle or an option while looking at colours and designs so I did not have to go back and forth through the shipping screen for every iteration to see if the shipping has skyrocketed. Also we did follow the sizing guides so I think they need to update them.",7
"I bought two shirts same design different sizes one for me ,,one for my daughter,, I wrote a review already so this just a modified repeat . they got plenty of choices to find something to be interested in and various styles and colors and formats to add the design to.

The phone case came out exactly as pictured.I have a Samsung S9 which is hard to find a case for.The quality is top-notch and looks great.I love it!,7
Quality of the shirt was amazing as I ordered the soft cotton tee. The prints are silk screened and I'd be willing to pay more for inked in design which I hope they offer soon. Shirt had the weird plastic material smell so wash before wear.,7
"These guys are amazing. My package got lost in the christmas craze (not TeePublic's fault) and they replaced the order pronto! My package got found something like 5 weeks later and I let them know.

It should be on the ACTUAL sparkplug....not across it like its a random set of letters in front of the thing. Very disappointed in this creative and printing quality, overall.

They sent me a duplicate after I sent pictures of the error. The replacement showed up the same as the first & again I was told that was the correct printing from the warehouse. We���������ve all been wearing masks long enough through this pandemic to know the inside and the outside of a mask. I gave up after that and decided your company is just not woat I ordered, but that���������s a whole other story.

Customer service was great. The quality of the shirts was by no means $24 worthy shirts. That brand is the cheapest you can buy for printing.

"I previously bought 2 shirts from TeePublic which turned out fantastic and got to me exactly when I needed it. Loved the designs and decided to purchase more, although the rush shipping cost is quite overpriced.The 2nd time around was definitely frustrating. Although the customer service reps were polite, it didn't help that I spent more than necessary to purchase an order that wouldn't arrive on time. Since I didn't get responses quick enough to cancel the rush order that wouldn't arrive on time,I ran out of time to cancel my order and repurchase for regular shipping.I would still purchase more shirts from here, but $20 for ""rush shipping"" that would still take up to 5 days it a waste considering it is just t-shirts.The overall price and quality is fairly decent, there are other online shirt stores that give you better deals, but rush shipping with this company is not worth it. This is the last time I am paying that much for shipping for this type of product and quality.",7
I was very disappointed the size XL was like a sizesmall. I sent it to my granddaughter in Texas & she loved the T-Shirt but guess she needs a 3x according to YOUR SIZE CHART. Don���������t know how she can return it without a return label,7
I bought a Pizza King tee for my grandson for Christmas. Looks like the sizing runs smaller than most of his clothes. I hope I can do a return if it is too small. It also took a long time to recieve.,7

"The design is awesome and the tee shirts are not a heavy fabric, they're a nice light cotton....but here's the thing, your sizes. I ordered a large, thinking it would be like other larges, a nice comfy fit, and it's pretty darned tight. Tight as in I can't put it in the dryer or I'll never get it on again tight. If I were ordering again I'd order a 2X so that I could dry it w/no worries, and have a little wiggle room left over.",7
Fast & efficient service & I was kept informed of how my order was progressing.,7
Sizing is somewhat wonky and it took almost 2 weeks after being shipped for one of my packages to arrive with arrival time changed on the tracking app 3 different times.,7
"The masks were excellent quality, covered the entire face without having to constantly adjust and the pictures were excellent quality.I would definitely buy again.We had to wait awhile for the processing before shipping ( like 2-3 weeks) but that is my only gripe.I really like these masks.",7
I appreciate the service as well as the merchandise. HOWEVER I wasn't too thrilled about paying $80 for 3 t-shirts only to see them at a much cheaper price just a few days later. Again I'm am satisfied with the service and merchandise.,7

Great service and very quick response when you get in touch with them!,7
"My order arrived in good shape, but for the second time I've had an image breakdown quickly after the first couple of washes. I don't use harsh detergents and I wash the shirts inside out, but the images still look faded after the first couple of washes and within a couple months they wash out almost completely. It's not all the shirts, but of the 15 to 20 shirts I've purchased 7 have done this.So buyer beware.",7

"Tried twice to get this shirt. First time, terrible communication, kept me hanging on for weeks before telling me that they couldn't fill my order. Second time, they sent the wrong color. Seriously folks, who knew running a t-shirt company was so hard. No offer of a discount or apology. Never never using them again!Update: I did email as soon as I opened the package. Over 24 hours and no response.... Maybe they don't work on the weekends but clearly they have people responding to bad reviews.Update; it is 3 PM on Monday and still no response. No number to call and although they say you can chat at anytime I'm at a loss as to how you do that. So Anita maybe you could scoot on down the hall and get customer service off their butt.Update; 4 Days later I get a response saying I will be sent another shirt. No apology, nothing. We'll see if this one is right.",7

"Everything went well. Ordering was easy, and it got here quick",7
"My one critique is that, in the past, TeePublic shirts don't seem to last as long as other higher quality shirts, but I love the designs enough to accept it and keep coming back. I have a very social occupation as a karaoke DJ, and I am known for wearing funny and entertaining shirts, and TeePublic never fails to deliver on this. Keep up the great work, artists.",7

"I love my purchase, it is exactly as advertised! It was also shipped and delivered well before I expected it. All around I had a great experience.",7
"Poor fit. I am not a tall man, but I have broad shoulders so I ordered XL. The shoulder cut on this shirt is made for someone with very tiny shoulders. When I compare it to other XL shirts I own, its shoulder cut is about an inch shorter on each side, which renders this shirt useless.",7
Have not received my package. The little information i received from delivery is in the wrong zip code from my shipping address. Still haven���������t received any email ,7
"Shipping costs kept me from placing an order. Also it sure would be nice to get a shirt without words like ""Sorry, I'm busy holding my cats"" or something similar. Maybe more generic like ""Love my children"" or similar.",7
For north american sizing the shirts fit small and the long sleeves are short. Designs are nice.Soft t's are soft.,7
"Your sizes are not accurate.I ordered an XL v-neck t-shirt.Although the label says XL, the shirt is actually a small.Worthless to me and the shipping charges to and from make it useless to send back.Now stuck with a shirt that doesn't fit.Worst part, this was gift sent directly to the recipient.",7

I love my new tank top. I really wished you had women's sizes larger than 2X. It's the only reason I gave you three stars. I have to wear some kind of sports bra or something under this tank top because it's a man's.,7
Good quality and arrived much faster then expected. Sizes are appropriate,7

I ordered and paid for a shirt but it was not delivered. It has been about a month now,7
Returning the shirt. While it is very cute-it is very very small for what is supposed to be a women���������s size large-this is more like a child size large. No where in the description does it say fitted-and I really wouldn���������t even call it that-the person this was purchased for typically wears a size 7/8 but I upsized wanting it to be a little roomy in her-it was m,7

I absolutely love the shirts i got! I would really love it if the Curvy Girl and plus sized shirts came in as many colors as the regular t-shirts.

The thickness of the t-shirts, I absolutely HATE. Very poor quality and IF I order again I would NOT order a female shirt. I also think you guys should add the bright colors to the women sizes. I think I'm going to sale my Martin t-shirt. Sending it back will be doing too much",7

I love the pillow and the artwork on the t-shirts I got but sadly the t-shirts are not printed properly. The artwork on one of them was supposed to be centered but is quite noticeably off center.

Ordered a 64 GTO hoodie for my grandson. Quality was excellent but unfortunately it was too small. Tried to get an exchange for the next size larger but was told that they would send the next size larger at no cost. And I could keep the original smaller size gratis.

If you want to wait 2+ months for a product and receive snarky emails from their employees after asking where your product is, then this is the place for you. If you want your item in a timely manner, with even subpar customer service, please look elsewhere. Should be shut down!",7

"I don't normally buy printed t-shirts, but I found one I had to have and ordered. Shipping was fine up until it arrived at local USPS facility, where it sat for a couple weeks ""awaiting carrier pickup."" I finally decided to log a support request and, I'm not joking, received an email within 1 minute of a replacement being sent, and a couple minutes after that a response from an actual person telling me a new one was being sent out. Truly phenomenal customer service! If you see something you like, don't be afraid of them delivering the goods.",7
"Good experience, timely, no issues.",7
The Design on the shirt is amazing and exactly what I wanted! My issue is the quality of the shirt. I paid extra for the softer shirt. When I received the shirt I held it up and can see right through it. Since I paid extra for a soft shirt I expected a higher quality.,7

"I love the creative designs for the shirts! Only one thing- the material. I can live with it but I don't really care for the stretchy-ness and the clingy-ness of a lot of t-shirts made today, not just these. So, that's my own problem. But, cool, original designs, great communication and fast shipping, as well as a seemingly great appreciation for the many creators make this, too me, a great company!",7

So many colors and choices of what I wanted on the shirt. Reasonably priced and fast delivery.,7
"The shirts were exactly what I expected and a little better because they weren���������t too short like some tshirt companies. We loved that they had many color options and even different material for the shirts so we could get them all just what we wanted. There are SOOO many tshirt prints that it���������s tricky to get through them all to find exactly what you like, (even if you search specific words/phrases in the search bar) but if you have the time, it���������s still nice to have all the options.The kids sizing was a bit big, but will probably shrink in the wash, which will actually be perfect for us because I don���������t want to wash kids clothes special I just throw them all together. Heh.I",7

Nice quality shirts. Ordered from here multiple times and will order again.,7

"Ordered my product on September 8th; saw the tic to have it delivered by UPS for no extra charge. Thought I'd take advantage of it as a speedier means of receiving what I paid for. I was WRONG. Two days later I got the email that it was sent; but UPS had not even created a label or received the package for another six days. Then the package was immediately given to ""Mail Innovations"" to be sent through the USPS, and their station had not received the package for yet another four days. There it sat for about a week before it started moving. Then I get notice that it's next stop was Madison WI. Here, hoping I would get it soon checked the tracking, and Madison only got notice of it arriving. It got there another four days after and sat another three days before it was shipped to my hometown. All-in-all it took the better part of a month to receive it. When I contacted customer support, I got boilerplate and canned responses and told where I could check the tracking of the package. I mentioned that's where I got the info of it not even being delivered to the UPS or Mail yet, and got pretty much an ""oh well"". I order things from CA and Nevada from other countries that I receive in three days, there was no reason for this slow shipping and even less of a reason for the uncaring customer support.",7

The shirts are good quality, 100% cotton, and the prints are clean. We haven't washed them yet, so I can't speak to how they hold up. At this point I'd definitely order from teepublic again.

"Just got in another batch of TeePublic shirts and I continue to love this company.The designs are great and unique.My kids love picking out different things and we all get compliments on the designs.We have ordered over 30 shirts in the past couple of years and so far, so good.I have had a few issues with sizing and printing but TeePublic replaces anything no questions asked.Make sure you turn the shirts inside out before washing.It does make a big difference and not doing so degrades the printing.It happened to a couple of our shirts but we got them replaced without hesitation.You won't find a better customer service from a t-shirt company.I wish we could get the shirts quicker as it takes about 10 days to get but I guess that is not too bad for custom shirts.The only criticism I would have is the website search and cart.I sometimes have a hard time finding designs in the search and then key in another word or phrase and find the design that doesn't necessarily correspond.Also, I would love to be able to add designs to my personal 'list' and have the website save those.We like to research different designs and then accumulate a few for an order.You can spend hours researching designs and it would be great to be able to save for a future purchase.Perhaps TeePublic can work on that.Big Fan.",7

"I ordered 2 t-shirts and I love the designs and the quality is decent. However they seem long in the body compared to the chest measurement and I'm a reasonably tall female. Subsequently they are a little tighter in the chest than I would have liked, as the next size up would have been another 1.5 inches in length! That said, the measurements are as described in the size chart. I really liked the size guide with the photos, but I'm not convinced they are the same T shirts, as they do not look as long as they actually are. They arrived really quickly which was good.",7

The first tee I purchased was great however the art work was so large that the bottom was obscured when the tee was tucked in.Since you are not able to shrink the art work you gave me the option of either ordering a smaller size or an alternate design.

My order arrived quickly and the shirt quality is very good. Just as advertised.,7

"True to size, excellent quality, exactly as pictured, and came in quick. I am very satisfied and will 100% be purchasing more for sure!",7
"Shirt selection is great! Tri blend prices are a tad high for me to continually buy more shirts, so additional promos would help",7
I love the items I���������ve purchased. The mask is very comfortable & the tank is super soft. I would���������ve given you 5 stars but the last items I purchased....the one with trump flying the Hindenburg....has the word bigotry misspelled. It���������s spelled bigotery...instead of the correct ,7
"The T-shirts are gorgeous, wash well & are unique. Great company! Highly recommend them.Joan B.",7

I had a coupon I could only use on my phone i guess. So my order i placed on my desktop was expensive.,7

Fast delivery! Items just as described!,7
Shirt is all stretched out and a weird diamond shape. Not happy :(,7

Love the shirt : the print and design are fab!,7
Item was as described and arrived in a timely fashion,7
"Nice fabrics, lots of colors and nicely done graphics",7
There are many great designs to choose from. I really love that you can pick the size and color of shirt that you want it printed on.,7
The T-shirt looks great but the contrast writing to color shirt is not right. It should be dark lettering on light shirts. Can���������t,7
"Thickness of t shirt material was slightly more than I expected. Any less and I would not order again. Overall quality was more than I expected. Comfortable to wear. Printing is clear, precise edges, well applied and looks like its going to be there for a long time. Value is great and people are always staring at me now looking at my tshirts. Is this finally my 15 minutes of fame??? The selection is Wowww! The only reason I wrote this review is because the product is pretty impressive.",7

"I received one of my orders from Tee public. I had previously ordered from them before and had high expectations after my first order. But upon receiving my second order on my second visit to the site, I was very disappointed. One shirt I received was sent in youth large not an adult men's large. Another order, my hoody, was poorly manufactured. The shoulders were sewn together in a way that made it look like I had shoulder pads sewn into my hoody lol. Another problem was the delivery. The bag was damaged and looked to be cut with something. An upon opening one of my hoodies was damaged with a hole that had been cut in it. So this order was somewhat disappointing for me. Seeing as how most were Christmas gifts for other people. So im sorry to say I had to give them 2 stars this time around",7
"Great shirts, great art, fast shipping and wonderful service. Buy shirts from them.",7
The fabric and fit are fantastic.So glad I picked TeePublic out of all my choices!!!Highly recommended!,7

"Excellent Quality, just what I ordered..",7
"I love the products, but I don't love the shipping model. I'd rather have higher prices on individual items than get hit with a gigantic shipping bill at the end. I paid $20 to ship 3 posters, and I was very upset to have that surprise at the end. I wanted to cancel my order, but I'd already invested hours shopping, and I didn't have time to start over again.",7

"I was delighted to find artwork of a very difficult to find vintage truck. I ordered a tee shirt. It arrived quickly, in perfect condition. The fabric is so soft. I was a little worried about shrinkage, which I communicated to the company via email. They assured me that they would make things right, which I hope is not necessary. I will definitely deal with the company again. Their outstanding service aside, they have very cool and unique art.",7
"I ordered over a dozen shirts and mistakenly ordered a few Smalls, when I wanted Mediums. I reached out to customer service via the Contact Us portal and explained my situation and they are replacing my shirts with the correct sizes for five shirts; at NO charge!! I was so disappointed in myself ($$) when my order arrived and then wholeheartedly relieved and elated with the response from Teespring! Also, a competitor significantly lowered the quality of their shirts; and now, with better shirts and better service, I can never go back - THANKS Teespring! My closet loves you!",7
"The Zoey hoodie arrived a day early. My great granddaughter loved it.Everything was great about it!! Good quality , great design and fit perfectly .I will definitely shop again ere.",7
You have some nice t shirts but they run small. I usually wear a small but I ordered a medium ckassic T and it fits like a small. Maybe even like an extra small especially in the shoulders.,7
The design was cute. The shirt was a perfect size.I���������m 4���������10 and 88 lbs I ordered an adult small so there would be a little room just in case it shrunk. The design stayed on wa,7
"Gorgeous T-shirt, I love the design.",7
I was very happy with my purchase and surprised how quickly it came. My husband loved the t -shirt I got for him it's his favourite game and character from gears of war. Been looking for ages .,7
The artist did really good and I love Beavis and Butt-head and I never knew that someone could do that.,7
Great stuff! Quick delivery,7
Some inconsistency with sizing at times but they make things right.,7
My only complaint would be the shipping. USPS is by far the worst shipper you could use. Always have at least a 2 day delay because of them and their tracking is behind constantly.,7
Don't get me wrong these are nice shirts. However I ordered a McCaffrey tee and the player on it is not him. The player printed is the wrong race. These are gifts for my son for Christmas so I don't have time to return. Sigh,7
Customer service was excellent. I will definitely purchase from TeePublic again.,7
"Perfect, FAST DELIVERY AND EFFICIENT TRACKING",7
"The logo/ laminate is sticky and had a smell to it.... It sticks to itself when folded over... In going to wash it once and see how it does after that. It took quite a while to get the t-shirt delivered, also.",7

"Excellent, exactly what I was expecting.",7
"When i orded my product it, it ""said"" it was shipped within mintues on the website (as if there stick already printed). The next day the Hoodie went on sale and i was upset that i couldnt cancle the order to save some money due to USD to AUD dollar exchange rate (paid $100 for a hoddie). And a few days later got an email saying it was being shipped. So i missed out on my sale. Id like there to be a more of a clear shipping display website verse email. Also like a better description between what the difference is of a regular hoodie verses a premium hoodie.",7
Pleased! Graduation gift!,7
"Rob Schrab t-shirt's will have you repeating yourself, louder.",7

"The Flynns Arcade is very off center and crooked.. The karate kid is just off center. Can you replace,please?",7
The clothing is excellent quality and many if the t-shirts are very vibrant. Only thing keeping me from rating a 5 star is the jackets I got were very blurry print as well as the stickers I got. For the price iw as hoping they would be as clear and vibrant as the tshrit I received. Sent an email about it though. Last time they let me keep the messed up garment and they sent me another item made of another material to ensure the print was better so their satisfaction guarantee definitely works! Hopefully this time can go the same.,7
"Tee public is our go-to source for funny T-shirts. They offer the funniest T-Shirts that reference our favorite movies, even the most obscure ones. Their prices are reasonable, and their service is excellent. So give them a go!",7

It fit great and match with my jogging pants.,7
"My first design was flagged as a TOS violation- it���������s literally four letters I put together in photoshop.

"Prompt service and good communication. But I wish the white letters on the black hoodie had retained their brightness. Maybe you should come up with a better way to handle white letters on black fabric. These letters are kind of dull and faded looking, just blending into the black. No crisp edges.

I ordered 4 different colored 2x female cut shirts- I normally wear an x-large-1x but they advise you to order 1-2 sizes up. I ended up needing a 3x and theexchange was super easy but still tight in the armpits and unfortunately you dont have the full color range when you go that big and you pay more even though the 3x is no bigger than a mans 1x. Overall I love the concept and the customer service. Brown stretches nicely but beware of other colors running small.,7

"For the most part I really like getting t-shirts from teepublic, they have great options, But to be honest I have had some troubles in the past. I feel like some of the shirts I have ordered are poor quality prints. Like it looks like they where ironed on by a child.I have had three shirts that look that way and I paid 20 bucks for them. I would have sent them back, but it was not worth the hassle.I also absolutely hate that they ship with DHL!! My last order fell in to the shipping black hole, never to be seen again. Teepublic was wonderful to work with on getting new shirts, this time sent ups, and they got here in good time. But once again the quality of the print is not what I would expect for the money. I always have a worry when I order that I will not get my package or if I do, what will the quality be like. I double guess myself ever time I order, and when I do. I pray it all works out.",7

"Quality isn't what I hoped for. The white racerback tank fabric is so thin that I'll need to wear another layer underneath. Also, the graphic isn't as sharp as expected. For the price, I expected a better product. However, the fit is fine and I guess it is ""good enough"" for my cosplay purposes.

I really do love all the different cooldesigns. There are so many different and interesting artist to chose from. I have purchased several great T shirts withgreat themes. I also plan on purchasingmore . My onlycriticism (if you want to call it that) is I wish you had a place to store my favorites. I cannot tell you how many times I have searched for the perfect design and put it on my cart to hopefully purchase them at alater date. Then tofind out to mychagrinthat my all my choices have been scrubbed. I wonder if it wouldn't behoove you to have yourIT people make a que of favorite sellers and designs so a loyalcustomer like me doesn't go crazy trying findthe exact design? lol With that being said this is very cool place and company and will continue to support it with myhard earned money ....Thanks..

It came Christmas Eve and I wrapped it, when we opened it, there was a totally different shirt that had a roller coaster on it instead of a ball python.I have received one email apologizing and a coupon. Horrible horrible customer service even with understanding of holiday busy time. Even ifreceived it tomorrow, unacceptable! I ordered the first part of December as this was an important gift!",7
"I have ordered a couple times from Tee Public, and the designs they offer are original and fun. Never an issue with quality - until this Christmas. The sweatshirt I ordered had a small, dime sized tear/hole near the shoulder. I took a couple photos and sent them via the contact form 4 days after Christmas. Two hours later, I received an email apologizing for the issue and a new order was being sent out at no cost to replace it.So, about their customer service - IT'S AWESOME.",7

"Great t-shirts LOVE!! Only one issue, with me personally,I wish they would ship through a different avenue than the Postal Service,the item seems to ship when expected... but the items get held up for days through the Post office... My item has been at the same location now for 4 days... Wish they would go thru UPS or FED-EX",7
What made my experience great was being able to choose which color tshirt I wanted. Checkout was quick and easy. Shipping was fast and well packaged. The tshirt looked great. The material of the tshirt is soft and light.,7

I had a small issue and customer service was so helpful. Quick and taken care of,7
The Tee is very soft and comfy the image could be a little darker on the black tee. Great way to get what not everyone has if that makes sense.,7
Customers service at its BEST!!!Designs are unique & awesome!!,7

Tshirt arrived promptly and was as specified. Great job!,7
"Absolutely horrid company. Was promised by a certain date. Never showed. Then was promised a refund or reshipment of the supposedly lost package. I agreed but they then retracted their second promise and told me I had to ""knock"" on my neighbors doors to find who had it because FedEx delivered it incorrectly.Well I didn't want to be shot by a not so happy neighbor, so I complained to a higher up in the company. Took 8 emails to make this right. Poor customer service and a horrible experience. Stay away!!",7
"The item arrived on time and in good condition, which is all you need to ask for.",7
received shirt very quickly. only concern is the actual size. it says preshrunk so hoping it doesn't shrink further because then it wont fit. IMO they run a size small even preshrunk. So I will order a size up next time. other than that I love the shirt and cant wait to give it to the person it was bought for.,7
I actually thought the print was on the back and not the front. It���������s ok just not really what I,7

T-shirt with graphic looks good.Won't be able to give complete review until after Sept. 15 b/c that is when it will be worn.,7
The product (a t-shirt) was first class and I got posts about its arrival date.,7
Hate to be negative but here's my experience-The images were much blurrier than I expected for the price. I think the t shirt quality was fair but could have been a bit better as well. The images are funny and creative but part of the design was cut off or improperly printed on one of the shirts in my order.,7
The items I ordered arrived quickly and in excellent condition.I will absolutely continue to support artists and order from this site again.A few things were delayed but TeePublic constantly initiated email updates and order tracking.Excellent customer service!,7
Product was received by the due date and the shirt is of acceptable quality,7

Great quality and the order arrived ahead of schedule.,7
"The shirt is too long, almost like a dress but the print is amazing!",7
Amazing Exchange Policy! Size I ordered was correct but I found it to be a little snug. TeePublic sent me a new shirt one size larger and told me to keep the original T-shirt and give it to someone or donate it.,7
I got both t shirts and a sweatshirt.The quality is amazing!,7
The sleeve of the shirt has been sewn the wrong way and has a hole in it. Absolutely ridiculous!,7

This is my second t-shirt from TeePublic. Both were for concerts. Beautiful work! I am so excited! Thank you guys!,7
"Teepublic: a place to be scammed. After uploading my company logo, that I personally designed, created, and own, and ordering a few sample items to test for quality before promoting the merch to my followers, (which turned out wonderful, thank you producers) I discover my account has been disabled, my logo deleted, and no explanation as to why.After contacting Teepublic, initially I was given a vague ""you violated the terms"" message; but, I finally was informed that they needed me to prove that I own the rights to use that image, which again, was my own self made image and the trademark of my business. [Note: their own terms outline the penalty for a first alleged offense, as this was, if copyright infringement is the image will be deleted. Disabling accounts is NOT listed as a consequence for a first offense.]The way to verify was to send them all the Photoshop project files of the image. I did not use Photoshop, so I sent them plenty of evidence taken from flipaclip, the app I did use, and asked for information regarding the party who had made a fraudulent claim against my trademark so I could seek legal action if necessary. Their response: absolutely nothing. Multiple attempt to contact them all come up empty, then they have the audacity to follow up with a ""how was our support"" email.Months after this incident, I still have no access to my account, but I've realized something: if I had used Photoshop, and had sent them my project files, they surely would have taken the image and reproduced it for their own use, violating federal trademark law and my rights. With that in mind, beware of Teepublic. BTW, the star belongs to the companies that made the merchandise I ordered, Teepublic deserves less than 0 stars.",7
"Everything was good and delivered, just not a bit happy with the tracking and how everything was packed individually. Besides all, everything else was perfect.",7

"I am a 5'4"", 115lb woman. I ordered the olive green Plastic Kills t-shirt in a size small for me and there was no way it would fit. TeePublic sent me a second shirt in a larger size at no cost.

I plan on ordering from TeePublic again.",7

"I absolutely love my shirt! Like my coffee mug too!

I ordered my dad a shirt for his belated Christmas gift, it said it was delivered to him and he never received, I checked to make sure I gave the correct address and I did. So I said lets wait a week and still never showed. So I guess i wont be ordering from this company again, I cant afford to keep spending money and not receiving anything in return.

They sent a replacement that arrived very quickly. The gift was received, as described and everyone was happy. Their customer service is outstanding!!!",7

"The shirts I ordered were wonderful, and I'm sure will be well-received come Christmastime.My only criticism would be that had I known ahead of time that the packaging bag is emblazoned with lots of company logos, I would have made arrangements to ship somewhere other than home.Now everyone knows that they're getting the shirts they'd expressed interest in on your website!Ruined holiday surprise!",7
"Well, first... when I created an account and uploaded my art, 3 days later I got an email saying I violated terms of service. When I questioned them as to what terms did I violate, their only reply was to provide the original artwork.

Out of the 8 shirts I ordered, 1 was badly off vertically where the top half of the print was completely cut off.",7

I recently purchased a shirt from TeePublic and I can full heartedly say that these are some of the best shirts I���������ve ever worn they���������re very well fitted.

Awesome just wish it didn���������t cost $12,7
"I'm sad to write this review because I was very hopeful. I originally ordered a Billie Eilish graphic sweatshirt and the graphic online looks amazing, but unfortunately, it does not translate to the product. When I received my sweatshirt the graphic did not look like the quality shown online. It is faint and not as vibrant as the graphic shown online. I let customer service know and they were extremely friendly and helpful and said they would send another one right over and to keep the original. They were the best part of this experience.When I received the new sweatshirt it still looked dull and when I compared it to the original sweatshirt I got, they have made the graphic A LOT smaller on the new sweatshirt, possibly to try and make it more vibrant? I did not make much of a difference. Overall I'm disappointed in the quality of the print and terribly bummed because online the artist had made an incredible graphic. I wish I could attach pictures to show the difference but there's not an option to do so on this forum. I'm not sure if it's the individual artists printing it or TeePublic themselves but I would advise to be cautious because it might not turn out the way you think.",7
"The quality of the product is great, and while I had shipping issues TeePublic was quick with help and response.",7
Quality of image is great. I just wished they placed image lower so the top of the image wasn���������t cut off to accommodate the ,7
The shirt I ordered's design was printed over a random piece of string that looks awkward and will that will eventually come off & strip out some of the shirts design print.,7
I am homebound and it's great to be able to order on-line.,7
"Great prices, an incredible variety of designs, quick delivery!",7
The t-shirt that I ordered seems smaller than what I had anticipated. I ordered an adult large and it fits more like an adult medium. Also the picture on the shirt was not printed straight,7
Great shirts! Fast delivery,7
Very pleased with the quality of the product and the accuracy in size.,7
"Love the replacement shirts we got from Tee Public. Best designs. Men���������s sizes are fine, but would still be concerned ordering women���������s until certain they���������ve worked out the sizing iss",7
"Lots of great designs! I went looking for one design and bought three!! I took away 1star because not all of the colors have the same fit- not a dealbreaker, though.",7
"While the designs are fabulous, the T-shirts used to print them on differ in size depending on the color, so if you order a M in royal blue and a M in turquoise, they may not fit the same.The blue M fit beautifully, but the turquoise M was so small that I had to buy an XL for it to fit.Also, my first order, the art was printed crookedly and it bothered me so much, I had to give the shirt away.Other than those two things, the service is great. Since they made everything right, they get 4 stars! So if you are buying these for a gift, bear that in mind and make sure to measure the person (or ask for the width of their favorite T-shirt and check against the sizing link.Save yourself a bunch of back and forth.",7
I get this almost every year for my brother and he loves them. Great quality in sweatershirts. I find the prices a bit expensive but the quality is great so its ny once a year spurlge on him.,7
Not a fan of the way its printed. Shirt was a big smaller looking than an mens XL,7

"Their customer support was great, and the sweatshirt came exactly as advertised.",7
"They have unique designs, which is nice, but some problems:- Shipping can be very slow- T-shirt quality is below average- T-shirts run small, to the point I don't wear them much because of the fit- T-shirts stink when they arrive (ink smell?)- Graphics on the shirts often more faded than they appear on the website",7

Service was great and the product is outstanding,7

"Choices, ease of order, quick delivery...what's not to love?! Well--for me--I'm not a fan of how the t-shirt smells. No big deal--I'm sure it will smell better after a wash, but 1 star deduction for that.",7
"I found the material to be not very soft, it was for my grandson so hoped for softer material. Also the graphic design wasn't very clear, several if us couldn't make out the writing. I did find the customer service good, ordering was easy and it arrived in fairly good time",7
Excellent service,7
"Great product, fast shipping!",7
"TeePublic made shopping for funny shirts easy and they delivered really quickly.We were happy enough with the t's we received, I would have been even happier if the fabric content and weight could be established before finalising the order as we would have paid a bit more to get the heavier weight cotton. By the time I found it we'd already placed the order and couldn't be bothered to find out how to change it, as we ordered 14 t's, it just seemed too much.We will order again but next time I know to pay $2 more per t and get the heavier weight cloth.I'm a trade qualified dress maker with 20 yrs experience , I was quite impressed that the t's were cut on the grainline , if they are not as is often the case they then twist and hang crooked.The seam work passed my inspection too.So well done TeePublic for a good product. Just remember to tweak your website a little bit.And no, they didn't pay me for this review",7
"3 of 4 shirts were just as pictured, but unfortunately one of the previews totally misrepresented the color of the shirt in contrast to the color of the design. I can't even read part of the design on the shirt because they are so similar... In the preview however, they are clearly and easily distinguishable.",7
Design very well done.Cotton shirt looks real good.,7
This was a gift for my GrandSon.He loved it and he gets so many compliments.I���������m so glad I ordered both the t-shir,7
"Ordered five shirts (two adult size for me; three youth size for my son). Quality of the shirts is very good. Only complaint is a word on one of the shirts is misspelled in big, bold red type. (If I had looked closer at the photos online, I would've realized word was spelled different in the shirt description than it was on the actual shirt).",7
Order 3 shirts with the same image.Two shirts looked great one was obviously messed up during the iron transfer process. I honestly can't believe it was shipped. Also the sizes are way too small. I ordered up one size as one review suggested. Should have ordered up 2 sizes.,7
"Order arrived in a timely manner, and exactly as I thought they would look. The shirt material is great! Always satisfied with our purchases from TeePublic!",7
Awesome. But too small under the chin coverage for a 9 year old.,7
Very pleased with the service and t shirt I received.,7
"I have found the best t-shirts on TeePublic. I like Zazzle and CafePress, but I keep ending up buying from TeePublic. The materials are good. The shirts fit as expected. The artists are many and to my liking. I'm happy with my purchases.",7
Great quality shirt and screen print. Easy to order and shipped timely too.,7
This company is fun to shop at and is pretty easy to upload artwork for tee shirts and other items. I have contacted them twice (once for a problem and they last to offer them an idea for other products) and each time they have gotten back to me the NeXT day. Friendly!,7
"The best shirts, rare designs you can't find ANYWHERE. Not even Amazon has clothes this unqiue. Lots of sales. Good customer service. I highly recommend!",7
"Dear Tee,We own a Chiweenie, and this tee shirt captures his personality, perfectly. I'm giving this to my wife, ""Mommy"", whom he loves somuch ! She is coming home tomorrow, from just having surgery ! She will be thrilled, and both me and the Chiweenie will be rewarded !A great welcome home gift !",7
"I recieved my ""t' in a very reasonable time and Ilook forward to doing business withTeePublic again.",7
The shirt was what I ordered beautiful. The sizing is smaller than expected. Ordered X-large so it would definitely fit a little baggy. When it came in it���������s quite a small X-L. Wish I would h,7
The shirt I ordered was so soft! The perfect gift!,7
Love the t-shirts ! Great quality - sizing perfect - delivery great - and when I did have a query the customer service was spot on - highly recommend tee republic - Brenda,7
Couldn't ask for better service or product!Completely happy with everything I purchased (all Phil Collins items)...super fast shipping also!,7
"Designs and colors and service are excellent. The only problem is that the website states that the shirts are ""pre-shrunk"". Based on this information, I ordered shirts that fit my actual size. I washed the shirts in cold water and dried them on the ""Low"" setting. They came out of the dryer as tight-fitting muscle shirts, not regular-fitting Tee Shirts. If, in fact, the shirts are pre-shrunk, they still shrink more than any pre-shrunk shirts I have ever purchased.",7
Awesome shirts as always.The quality of the the shirt and print are excellent!,7
I love the amount of shirts to choose from. My Husband loved the shirts I chose and the shipping to delivery time was very quick.,7
"The tees arrived quickly.They run small and the large did not fit me, altho I normally wear large.",7
Quick delivery! Great product! Would order again!,7
Product exactly as advertised. Arrived quickly and was well packaged,7
Prompt service and good sizing descriptions.,7
"We ordered two extra large women���������s T-shirts. The style is exactly what we ordered, but the size is nowhere near what it should be. Even though the shirts are tagged extra large, they are smalls at best Please send us a retu",7
"Shipped quickly, good quality. I suppose that should be standard service from any company. These days we have to rate it five stars.",7
Poor quality tee. One of them had a hole just below the logo.,7
Nice material. Good fit.,7
"Great shirt, good value. It was a gift and my hubby loved the design.",7
"Product online didn't look exactly like what I received. I also ordered a 2X but what I received would normally fit someone looking for a medium. The sizing is terrible. I'm not ally a 2X and this was a waste of money, I should've bought a 4x if I had known",7
Shirt is of great quality and received in a timely manner. Great experience.,7
"I like the sweat shirts very much even though they appear to be of a lighter weight material than most retail stores sell.The key for me is if the logos hold up after washing.If so, l will refer others to your site.",7
This was a gift for my husband. He loves it. It fits perfect and the print is great!,7
Was very pleased with the shirt! The shipping on TeePee was great but the shipper was bad.,7
"Most of the tees I bought turned out great. A few of them, tho, with photographs as images, weren't high enough resolution to work well printed on shirts. The Van Morrison Tupelo Honey and the City of Norfolk 1892 image teeshirts in particular.",7
Quality of the cotton not up to the price. Size was good.,7
Awesome purchase great quality t shirts I am a very happy repeat customer,7
"I ordered some masks and the designs turned out great however the mask fit is kind of ridiculous. It���������s too loose, and the part that covers your face doesn���������t cover your nose and whole chin. It���������s not wide enough from nose to chin and so it slips right off my nose since it������",7
Love the design. The image transfer was incredibly poor. It literally came out the brand new out of the bag already cracked and chipping. Won't be ordering from teepublic again.,7
Always great service and communication! This not my first time ordering and won��������,7
I like the quality and value I have found in the products on this site. I bought 2 t-shirts and a hoodie for my four year old grandson. All were great quality fabric and the graphics were of excellent quality as well. Will definitely order again and will recommend to all family and friends!,7
"Had a concern from product prematurely fading.I let you know, Andrei emailed and took care of everything leaving me a satisfied customer.",7
"Purchased mens long sleeve tee shirt. I ordered because of a design selection. Have never ordered from this company before. The price was unexpectedly reasonable and I also got 30% off. Because of the low price, I did not expect high quality. Was very pleasantly surprised, and plan on ordering more from them in the future.",7
"Easy, fast, great prices.Only wish is that whoever is making t-shirts nowadays would go back to the old, thicker material...they last much longer!",7
Awesome!!!! You have the sizes I need ! Turned out great for Christmas!!!,7
Great quality on the shirt & even better quality in customer service!,7
I love the artwork from Frightening Icons.,7
"I've ordered many times and the shirts are too quality, put perfect, ship quickly and are priced fairly.",7
"Second time ordering from here but this time ordered a couple sweatshirts.Only unisex men sizes are available, so I ordered up size and I was swimming in it. Requested an exchange and got within 5 days. No hassle and didn't even have to send back the other sweatshirt.I was a little apprehensive about starting the exchange process via email but the customer service was responsive and took care of it. Happy, satisfied and will be returning for more.",7
It was perfect service. Perfect delivery delivery of the product I ordered everything was correct. It always is. I love dealing with your company.,7
I love the vibrant colors and quality of the shirts! Definitely will order again in the future! ����������,7
Order was processed and delivered much quicker than I thought. I was very impressed with the service.,7
The shirts are very soft and comfortable and the logos on the shirts are very clear and authentic i am very pleased with my purchase and I will definitely shop with this website again.,7
"Beware of size when selecting. Great graphic options and large selection. Found a Mortal Kombat shirt for my 9 year old son. No matter how hard I tried to figure out sizing (youth, juvenile, kid)...I still got it wrong. I ended up with a youth small and it is ""maybe"" more like a kids 6 at best. Wanted something closer to a 10. I should have ordered a YOUTH LARGE (these tees will shrink). Please be sure you are on the right tab when you place the order (youth, juvenile, kid, etc...) and order UP in size. I had to donate the shirt because it was way too small.",7
F'n A Cotton... F'N A.... This speaker is fire. Went from a pretty good setup that was fine w me to this and I'm never going back. Even on lower end equipment it works amazing!!! Arrived within 2 days. Purchase #2 and will come back!!,7

The shirt fit great and was delivered on time.,7
"Perfect���������.+ 18 characters. 25? OK, no this review has ",7
Prices were really good. Ordered a couple of shirts to the place I was Living/working at but got fired. Against my express wishes they refused and returned all my mail. The customer service people at TeePublic were great and arranged to have the items shipped again to my home address. Would definitely buy from them again.,7
"The shirt was stained, looked like from the print.",7
The shirts came out perfect! Exactly what I wanted.,7
I got this for my husband. It was just as expected. I will place future orders. Be warned that the shipping they use will take longer than expected. It will say it is gonna be delivered on Monday. Monday comes and goes and it says it will be delivered on Tuesday���������.then it comes on Wednesday. So just plan on adding about 3 days delivery time to the expe,7
"Ordered four shirts. Mine was fine but I ordered my daughter a medium female not knowing how small they were. Ended up having to order her a medium male, it was my mistake. The shirts are nice and I will order from teepublic again",7

I ordered two tee shirts with wording on the front.The words were positioned pretty low such that they put the words across my stomach rather than across my chest.Should have been placed higher.,7
I received my T-shirt that I ordered for my granddaughter and it was very nice! I know she will love it!,7
"You sent the T-shirts faster than your competition and everything arrived OK,however please tell this old fart what an indie artist is !!! In my travels I have heard of India and the West Indies (It also confused Columbus-however you spell his name) so how about a geography lesson. Love and kisses,Tom in Montana",7
"EDITED TO ADD: I changed the rating from two to four stars because TeePublic reached out to me after this review and sent me new shirts with the printing I expected. Excellent customer service.I ordered four shirts. Shipping was wonderful, they arrived quickly. Designs were fantastic- the artists are great! But the printing was terrible and honestly look like iron on���������s. I am kind of embarrassed to wear them. I expected them to be crisp like they looked online or like they are from any othe",7
The Tee was exactly as advertised. My son loved the Pacific rim design. We ordered two of size 7.He is lean and it fit little loose. we made a request for an exchange with size 6. The response was quick and process went smoothly. I will be ordering more in the future !! Customer service was amazing.,7
I received my merchandise in a timely fashion and ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY sweatshirt as we as my t-shirt.,7
"Bought this shirt for my dad, he���������s a big guy and is really picky about how his shirts fit. He���������s a 2x normally, but I got a 3x just to be safe and it fit him good with extra airflow... I would say that the 2x would have fit him as well but obviously a bit tighter and less airflow. Sizing is correct, material as expected and quality of print was really great! Will ",7
He loved them!! Just wish shipping wouldn't have taken so long,7
Love all 3 shirts! Prompt delivery! Very soft material! Packaged well!,7
Product as described and great quality. Fast shipping!,7
Awesome costumer service! I love the material of the t-shirt and the design is also very nice. The only issue I had was after washing it a thread came out and a whole seam was just not a seam anymore.,7
Terrible service.Slow to ship--paid and then week later get the message--not shipped yet.Why not?No reason given.$9.00 postage for UPS shipping which was turned over to the USPS who could have delivered it for less than half. Ridiculous.Shirts are of very poor quality--super thin material which won't survive many washings.Will never order from this site again.,7
"I love these shirts on my husband, he has a big belly but nice arms���������each one looked amazing on him. He is rather short, they c",7
Great service! I got a hart foundation t shirt and i love it. It was shipped and delivered very quickly. The only issue i had was the hot pink writing is almost invisible on the hot pink version of the shirt. maybe switch the color of the text for that one.,7

Loved the product and the (great!) service.,7
I got what the site stated I was ordering and got it in a decent amount of time. The quality of items vs. the price of items was good.,7
"So I love Teepublic.I love the designs. And the delivery is fast and the customer service is responsive. My one real knock against all of it is...after ordering close to 40 T shirts, they don't last very long.It's almost like, I buy these knowing they will look old after 3 washes.And the letters will often be cracking off in 3-4 washes.So, I treat the shirts almost as disposable. Also, they seem to be decidedly Right Wing in design choices on certain topics like NPR, which I find odd for a group of indie artists.But don't believe me...search NPR and CNN and see what they sell.",7
The order took almost a month for 2 shirts. When we did receive them they were the wrong size. The shirts were very poor quality and the printing was atrocious.I emailed them immediately and received a response asking for pictures. I sent those immediately. 1 week later and I have yet to here anything. With this type of customer service and poor quality merchandise I highly doubt I would ever order again!!,7
I have ordered shirts from several other companies and the quality was just ok sometimes not good at all. But when I got my shirts from TeePublic the quality was great!I am 100% satisfied.,7
Shirts were exactly as shown on website. Great job!,7

The order was what I wanted and good quality.,7
"It's perfect in look and feel, but I'm worried it might be too small. It's a Christmas gift, she's 10 but tall, so I got a Large. We'll see in a few days how it fits.",7

"Asked a question, response was immediate.Rec'd T-shirt, looks fantastic, hope it fits my brother (it's a gift).",7
"The shirt I ordered for my father as a Christmas gift was lost in the mail. Neither USPS or UPS would claim responsibility for the lost package even though the item was lost between a transfer from UPS Mail Innovations and UPS. I filed numerous claims with USPS and no one bothered to look for the shirt (They blamed UPS). I sent TeePublic several messages and receive little to zero help. I was told by a TeePublic rep that all items would be delivered by Dec. 24 (I ordered this item in early December). But it was obviously lost. I was also told in a secondary message after another inquiry that a replacement shirt could be expedited to me but would not reach me by Christmas (No Kidding!) ... and why tell me that after my initial contact with customer service. Bottom line - you gave me a refund but I earned it with the amount of hours, emails, phone calls, and work I put into finding this shirt in the system. It arrived about a week after Christmas btw. But that was too little too late.",7
Great quality and they shirts arrived relatively soon.,7
I love this site!! There are so many beautiful designs available and the quality of the Shirts are outstanding!,7
"I���������m impressed with this company.The tee shirt arrived quickly, and looked just like the photograph.And, they noticed that I had mistakenly ordered the same thing twice and cancelled the second one and notified me.

The shipping was incredibly fast and the shirts and masks are all high-quality!,7

Loved the Wiggles shirt I ordered for my grandson. He loves them. Shirt is good qualityand came in on time,7
Loved the shirts! Great designs! Would be 5 stars but paying extra for larger sizes is like punishing people for being fat.,7
X-Large shirts are a little bit small compared to shirts I have purchased from various other retailers on average in the X-Large category. I would say they are closer to what I have seen or purchased labeled as Large from several manufacturers. Good quality.,7

Excellent product. Grandson loved it,7
I ordered an XL Womens Tshirt and received a girls XL instead,7
I never imagined I would simply adore & go crazy about a great group of folks that manage a tee-shirt business. I've just ordered my third T.

They rock and they have heart. And integrity.,7

TeePublic has a good number a tee shirt designs and a good range of colors for their products. It's cool they give their designers a platform to sell their works as well as a good compensation for the work they put into designing art for everyday folks. Had no issue with the delivery service.,7
I received the shirt 2 days after we wanted it and it was way too small.I had ordered a women's 2XL and it was maybe the size of an adult small.,7
I needed to return the first tee I ordered.. customer service was great! I now have a tee that fits and looks great!,7

Great product options and I love the fact that I'm supporting indie artist. The time frame from ordering to print/production and shipping is a bit long. I ordered a children's size hoodie and reviewed the size guide before ordering but my item looks to be poorly sized and ill fitting.So I will hopefully be able to exchange it.,7
"My initial purchase was way small and poor quality. I wear a L/XL and ordered the XL. I let them know after they asked if I was satisfied. They basically said I ordered the wrong shirt. Classic Tee must mean something different these days other than a regular tee shirt. They did send out a better, bigger shirt. They had a different name/fit for it. They sent the XXL. It is too big (as I expected) but at least I can wear it. They did stand behind their guarantee and made the effort to get me a shirt I can at least wear so I commend them for trying.",7

I have chosen to get the goods nevertheless as I have already ordered with Teepublic before multiple times. The quality of the fabric (standard t-shirts) is very good, although the prints sometimes had a poor quality - not sure where about the reason - most of the times they are brilliant.I will definitely continue to order goods with Teepublic.",7
T-shirts are thin as gauze and at LEAST one size smaller than indicated on their ad. They will NOT accept returnsor exchanges. This place is a completer rip-off SCAM!!!,7
"I loved the ability to custom create a shirt with a logo they offered (that I was having trouble finding on my own, so super win that they had it!) and am super pleased with the quality. It looks terrific! I wish shipping was a little faster & the shirt smelled like vinegar but I���������m sure a wash will get that out. Still 5 star for me because TeePublic allowed me to give",7

The service was excellent and professional, would order again anytime. My husband loves the t shirtand we then ordered another for my bro. Great company!",7
"None of the t-shirts fit, which is fine, because I was told they would all be replaced, but according to what has been shipped as replacements, everything is still wrong. I requested that all the women's shirts be replaced with a men's size medium, because the medium shirt I ordered was the only one that fit my wife. I also requested that the cranberries shirt come in light blue but it looks like they sent black. I requested that the Evanescence shirt (which I was told was out of stock) be replaced with a similar Evanescence shirt in the same color (brown) but it looks like what has been sent is in light blue. It also appears that the Dream Theater shirt has been replaced by a completely different shirt, not the men's large which I requested ������������",7

"The shirts are very unique and well made.Only one problem, tee Public was supposed to check with a designer to see if they could put the design on the back instead of the front and they never got back to me.That is the Tee Public employee would never followed up on it but the actual shirt designers and the the designs are fabulous.",7
"My last communication about another shirt replacement was partially complied with but without the professional courtesy of any explanation or advice as to why it was partially and not fully complied with. That's one reason for one star.But with the latest replacement shirt (a 2XL) we at least could verify that the 2XL size is not like the L and the M sizes, that were in fact much too small and were identical in size and merely bearing different incorrect size labels, the 2XL that just arrived is in fact bigger and not so unreasonably far off the actual size that it should be. Not the style requested, so an explanation rather than ignoring that part of the request would have been the right thing to do rather than ignore the customer's communication on that part.TeePublic has never directly addressed the issue of the identical sizes of the L and the M that were received and I take that as an admission that you have a bad t-shirt supplier. But the coffee cups were good, although the shipping is pretty high and that is turning some other buyers off.",7
your designs are great. i hope to submit my own soon.,7
This shirt was more then what I expected my wife is in love with it.,7
"Great service , quick shipping!",7
"The first t-shirt did not arrive so I contacted your company and it was replaced quickly.The design is great, but the sizing is weird. I ordered a size large for my daughter thinking she would be able to sleep in it and it just fits her.",7
Top. As usual.,7
"Great service, most willing to accommodate fun tee shirt.What more can you want?",7
Shipping time was fast even during the busy holiday month of December. The shirts were great and my brothers loved them!,7
Love the design.Arrived quickly!,7
you deleted my account for literally no f*ckin reason sooo���,7
"I will definitely order from TeePublic again just for their humor alone! But the fact that the artist benefits immediately from the purchase and how much my granddaughter loved her hoody, I know this will be a better option than Amazon!",7
Love everything we have purchased. Great quality items and excellent service.,7
Love both my tank tops!!! I only wish that I had ordered a smaller size. The L is huge!!,7
"The designs are great, I was, however, super disappointed that the sweatshirts weren't stretchy or built for comfort/lounging. I like comfort, not to feel like a sausage. The quality of the sweatshirts was good, I'm just saying sweatshirts are generally stretchy and comfortable, which these are not. I really like the Medusa design, and the 1972 one is for a costume.",7
"great products ,good quality and the shipping is fast. If I ever have any issue they correct it immediately",7
"Easy to order, received quickly. Fits true to size and super soft material.",7
Awsome shirt great job.l/v it,7
"I ordered a shirt that was designed for one of my rowing team boats and I was super stoked to receive it in the mail.However, when I got it and tried it on, it was way too small, which was surprising given that I've ordered many shirts of the same variety and they fit just fine.In any case, I wrote to TeePublic and they immediately responded and were more than willing to send me a new size.I didn't even have to hassle with sending back the original shirt as they told me to use it as I see fit.So in my book, this is a huge win.Thanks for making this right and keeping me a satisfied customer.",7
Fast delivery! Experienced and helpful customer service when I mistakenly double-ordered. And a great quality t-shirt to boot! Who could ask for anything more...,7

I loved it was just as pictured,7
The masks I ordered were flimsy and might only fit a stuffed animal of small size.This was supposed to be for a 7 year old.The T shirt had a great saying but on the gold shirt it was very difficult to read what it said.,7
I love the selection. Great service.,7
"Good quality material.....but I mistakenly ordered in white instead of the black I wanted....the printing is in white, so it is basically invisible.Now that is totally on me for not double and triple checking...but WHY would you offer a tee-shirt with white printing in white?",7
"They have so many custom designs, you could find just about anything you could want. The quality of the product is excellent as well. I love the jojo hoodie I ordered!",7
"Bought a shirt for my daughter, she loved it! Great quality will definitely order more product from this site.",7
I love that you offer aspiring artists a platform to sell their art in t-shirt form. Have gotten quality work from them. Looking forward to future stuff.,7
The t shirt is high quality and the I love the graphic. It arrived a day earlier than I expected which helped me have all gifts under the tree in time!,7
"Great range of designs.However, their female sizing is not good, despite their website sizing gizmo.I bought the standard fit for a friendand it turned out too narrow and too long.So I opted for ""curvy"" when ordering for myself but that was miles too big!Secondly, delivery is very unreliable.If you're buying for someone's birthday, my advice is order a few weeks in advance to avoid disappointment.",7
Great shirts and even better customer service this will be the only place I order custom shirts from again,7

"I ordered a number of T shirts and was impressed by my ability to customize several aspects. Type/style and color of shirt could be selected for each item and then displayed to assist in decision making. The measurement charts were very helpful/accurate when making shirt size selections also. Standard delivery from the US to Canada was slow as expected taking approx. 3 weeks BUT there were no additional fees required, just the amount I had originally paid online when placing the order. Shirts were of good quality, color and images all were accurate making me pleased to place this order from TeePublic for the first time. I will look to them again for other unique t-shirts!",7

The shipping was $6.99 on the first purchase but when I found many other cool tees to purchase there was a set rate of $29.95 to ship to Hawaii.As a result I will be unable to afford shopping with you.What a shame!,7
"The shirt was good quality, but it came all stained on the white area around the center graphic. Can't post photo of shirt smh",7
The shirt was to short length was horrible.,7
We visited our son to whom these shirts were to be sent and learned that they were never received.What course of action would you advise,7
"The print quality from TeePublic is *awful.* The colors were wrong, the register was off (not a little bit -- WAY off), and the text was practically unreadable. I contacted a different vendor immediately upon receiving my product in the mail.The reason it gets two stars instead of one (or zero, if TrustPilot had that option) is because the website kicks @$$.",7
The timing of shipment & delivery were very good,7
"While my order got messed up a few times, their agents provided quality service to get this resolved.",7
Garbage.The worst t shirt I have ever purchased.Looks to be laser printed or something.I would never recommend any pur hase from this company.,7
"I was so impressed with the t-shirt and service I received from TeePublic. I spent a couple of dollars more to get a thicker t-shirt, and it definitely was a thick, durable material. The picture printed on front was centered perfectly and the colors are deep and beautiful. I received it much more quickly than expected, within a week of ordering. It was a birthday gift for my husband, who is extremely picky, and he loves it! I will definitely be ordering from TeePublic again!",7
The shirt I ordered came in a very short period of time. The shirt fits perfectly and is very good quality. The fabric is soft and the design is perfect. I will definitely be ordering more and will recommend them to everyone.,7

"Description/image of ""Dulce Periculum"" showed white lettering on a field of black, no edging or bordering, what arrived was white lettering edged in black on a field of white, not something I can put on a black auto without looking ""tacky""",7

Be sure to order sizes up especially women's sizes. My daughter usually wears large so I ordered xl. Might fit our dog...,7
"Service was great and turn around time was excellent. I only wish the brand of shirt used was better. Gildan shirts are very short. They never fit properly. They are also very thin and get turn or worn out very easily. They also shrink a lot in the dryer. A brand such as Goodthreads makes a much better fitting and durable shirt which would leave your customers with a better product. I want to order several of the shirts that I see on your site, but I'm nervous now that I received Gildan shirts. I am placing a second order with a ""premium"" shirt option. Hopefully it's a better brand. Again, your team and workmanship seem great. It's just a shirt brand issue.",7

"My By- DON face mask. Too small,thin, flimsy.",7
"First off the shirts were super soft and I am long done with scratchy tshirts. Why would you buy these when you no longer have to? Second both designs of Cobain were nice, but you really all need to have a look of the face only print. Its intense and looks like an actualy painting. The hoody feels good as well, its a new shape. I really like this!. At first it felt funny, but then I realized it was actually fitting me correctly. The graphic on the back could have been more clear or something? Brighter? Or maybe its just depressing when it should not be Being towards the end of his life for me its a depressing thing but a celebration of his last music. If the shirts and hoody hold up after being washed a couple of times I will be back for sure.Bravo to all the artists and graphic designers. My business is online and also has been affected. I am happy to support you.",7

Great service! Tee Public has a great selection of original art���������. I amComplimented on all ofMy tees and the stick,7
Shirt sizes are crazy wrong.But TeePublic made it right!,7
The itemI purchased which was the corona face mask was great!!It was a hit amongst family and friends. A few people ordered as well. Recommended!!Thumbs up!,7
"I have used TeePublic twice now for sending adorable t-shirts to my 3 young grandsons over the past few months, and I have to say I could not be more satisfied! The design choices are so extensive and so reasonably priced, the most difficult part of the process has proven to be narrowing down my choice to one per boy!I especially love how easy it is to navigate the website. Whenever I plug something specific into the search bar, I'm taken immediately to (tons!) of suggestions that are actually relevant to what I want. I definitely can't say the same for the other sites I've tried in the past. TeePublic is my company of choice from here on out!",7
The t shirt is super soft and the quality of the printing is awesome!I paid for expedited shipping and got my shirt as requested.,7
My order was in a size that Ended up being too small. It was very easy to get a new order in the next size up wonderful results,7
"This is a great site! Very easy to use, I love it!",7
I got the wrong size and it doesn't fit as well as i want. I hope there is a way to exchange it for a bigger size,7
Very poor material and lack of followup per customer service.,7
"The print was terrible, one shirt has half of the print with fade out colours",7
"Love the shirts and the service.When there was an issue with sizing, they sent a replacement immediately.",7
I had an issue with an item.They were very quick to respond and rectify the situation.Very fast response.,7
"Graphics were exactly as advertised.Fabric is not suitable for preventing COVID-19, but it can easily be doubled up with another mask to be more reasonably effective.Masks arrived quickly.",7
"I've submitted a review about how poorly my product was It seems as if I got an automated response, Because no one reached out to me to rectify my situation. I ordered a shirt for someone and the quality was so bad. I would like a refund for this sort of service I could've had this shirt made elsewhere for that type of money.",7
These tshirts run small. A woman���������s medium would fit a t,7
Website was easy to navigate.Product was exactly as advertised and delivered in a timely manner.,7
the shirt are very thin and not true to sizes and plus you don't call back or respond to email as promise. I want order anything from this company unless I speak with someone from this compnay,7
Excellent. Highly recommend.,7
I like the product but I did not appreciate the fact that I got charged double for my order and was sent 2 of the same items. I only submitted my order once but somehow it went thru twice. I don't think I would be ordering from this company ever again.,7
Great quality and fast shipping. Very pleased with my order.,7
The shirt is perfect but the adult S looks like a child's size. Shirt is not big enough.,7
Lots of cool stuff to buy! Had trouble getting the discount code to work on my order. Contacted customer service and they gave me a refund for the discount in a reasonable amount of time. Was disappointed in the tracking for 3 out of the 4 shipments. They were rarely up to date. One even said it was supposed to be delivered on Saturday 6/27 on Sunday 6/28... received it on Monday 6/29.I did receive all of the items I ordered and am happy with them.,7
I placed a last minute (5 days before) family t-shirt order for my son's high school graduation!! The shirts arrived just in time for the party and were exactly the same as the online design!! Sizes fit good on everyone!!! Will definitely order again!!!,7
great selectionhappy with product delivery took 2 weeks though ;((,7
The image on the tee is way smaller than the image shown. If this happens reach out to TeePublic thru the contact link and they will quickly respond and remedy the problem.,7

Love the t shirt but the size is a little small for a large.,7
I love the shirts I purchased but they run about 2 sizes too small. I wear an XL and ordered a XXL so it would be comfy and when I put it on it fit like a L.,7
"Graphics looked just like the pictures on the website. I ordered the tri-blend tee in 3 different colors, and they're all great - true to the pictures on the website, fit perfect, very comfortable (nice & stretchy). Also, the fit is very true to the size chart. (I measured a favorite shirt, like they suggested, and it measured exactly like they said it would.) Of course, this is before washing - I suspect it will shrink a bit. If I had any complaint, it would be that the tri-blend tshirts are pretty thin, so I don't know how long they will hold up. Given that, I wish they were a bit less expensive, but I understand with the custom graphics why they are what they are. These were my first shirts from TeePublic, and I will no doubt be ordering more.",7
First time shopping here the shirt sizing is spot on on. They were bought as gifts and they love them! I���������ll ,7

Fast and easy ordering! I loved the design options and also product options to apply them to (different shirt types). Printing was somewhat faded in color who I do not think was intentional but I actually liked it better.,7
Awesome designs and you can find just about anything here. I bought 2 sports shirts and 2 TV show shirts for Christmas. Ships pretty quickly. The prices are affordable.,7
So cool to be able to connect directly with artists.,7
"Fast shipping, love the design!",7
Great coffee cup for a WWII veteran on his 100th BD.,7
Everything I ordered was exactly as described and of good quality.Arrived in a timely manner and in good condition.,7
"The print on the sweatshirts is the worst I have ever seen.The fabric is not completely covered and the colors are off.Designers should demand that a decent printer be used; otherwise, their designs are poorly rendered.Since I find no means of replying to JM's reply to my original post above, I am editing my post to accomplish that.I wrote the post after several rounds of communication with TeePublic, including JM, and replacement of my order with a better, although still poorly-printed set of sweatshirts.Interesting that one never hears from the designer, only TeePublic.That's why I suggested that designers demand a different printer for their sweatshirts.DO NOT buy a sweatshirt from TeePublic until it can demonstrate that it has contracted with a printer which can produce a well-printed sweatshirt.This is the last comment I will make on Trustpilot, which seems to be merely a means to communicate with the merchant, while email is a much better way of doing so.I have said everything in my comments above, and I have no intention of continuing useless communication with TeePublic.",7
The tshirt was very poor quality fabric. It was tough and scratchy against the skin. The elastic at the wrists was way too tight and it makes the fit of the shirt look strange in that area. There is no return policy and I don���������t want to exchange the shirt for another low quality shirt. I won�����,7
"I would recommend this site for service and quality of the work.I was looking for a particular print for the University of Puget Sound that I did not find on their website, and found TeePublic by accident, after doing a Google Search. I also had a T-Shirt done for DePaul University.The quality of the work and the speedy service is excellent. The reason that I gave this business 4 stars, is because I prefer a thicker T-Shirt.These are thinner, but that is my personal preference.",7
Your customer dervice is awesome. I had a size problem and it was fixed with no questions asked,7
"Easy ordering process, fast shipping and beautiful prints. Love them.",7
Good looking T-Shirt but the quality thicknesses of the t-shirt was not satisfactory.The delivery time was also unusually lengthy.Bottom line the designs are good but shirt quality and delivery time need to be improved.,7

Love Tee Public! They stand by their Holy Shirt Guarantee.,7
The t shirts and sweatshirts you have made are amazing.The quality is very good.The sweatshirts with dachshunds that I received turned out very bright and cheerful.You do an amazing job. Thank you..,7
It was a beautiful shirt and my cousin was thrilled to get a shirt with his ship on it.,7
I ordered it to match a shirt that my wife bought me. She was very happy because she wanted us to have matching shirts to celebrate our time together.,7
Overall very good but I had changed my design within 5 mins of the order and was still sent the original design. They are nice tshirts. I had emailed right after the order and they said they had received the change. That���������s the reason for the 4 stars. But I will definitel,7
There were lots of choices the staff were quick to respond to questions,7
"Shirt is awesome,and looks the way it does on the site,and fast service..",7
I was looking for a specific saying when I did a google search. This site popped up with the saying and an awesome looking design. The tee was customizable by size and color. It arrived within the specified amount of time and was exactly what I wanted. Will definitely use TeePublic in the future.,7

Love the shirt! It was a gift for my husband who is a Burt Reynolds and Norm MacDonald fan. He said it was his favorite shirt he got for Christmas:),7
"I love all the great original cute and humorous designs.As a huge Star Wars fan, I love all the options. The wide variety of colors is awesome as well.However, as a runner, I would love to have the option of getting these designs in a moisture-wicking performance t-shirt. I would be willing to pay more for that option. One of your competitors offered Champion performance shirts and they were good quality shirts. However, they do not offer any Star Wars designs.",7
"Great quality, the design was as cute in person as it was online.",7
Excellent service and FAST delivery!! Great quality tees!!,7
I was expecting a very cheap t-shirt but they printed on a good quality shirt that I might put into the regular rotation (as opposed to a rarely used shirt because it is uncomfortable).,7

"I needed sizes exchanged, they did not hesitate to replace the size, and told me to donate or gift the wrong one. As always, amazing customer service, and designs are great!",7
You sent me the wrong size (sent a youth medium and I ordered a small) and after I contacted you nobody ever replied. It CLEARLY says small on the order. I think they probably ran out of small shirts in that design so tried to pass off a medium instead of doing the right thing and sending what was ordered and paid for!! I am going to tell everybody how crappy this company is!,7
"I���������m a repeat customer of TeePublic, and I���������m just as satisfied as always! The designs are always terrific, the shirts I chose are soft and comfortable, and their customer service is excellent.It���������s so fun to check out all the great designs TeePublic offers, and equally cool to choose the color and cut of shirts to find exactly what",7

Unique gifts.Customer service is amazing.,7
Excellent service! They corrected an error so quickly.,7
"There was a slight odor when they arrived, but I think that's just from the screen printing process. We ordered the same shirt in 2 different sizes, both in the same color but the shirts were from different manufacturers so the navy colors don't quite match. But totally fine for what we need them for. Fast shipping and so many designs to choose from!",7
"Great product, fast shipping.",7
The t-shirt design is awesome!! I feel like the shirt is a tapered fit but believe it is still a unisex cut. Happy with my purchase!,7
"Ordered shirts for my whole family and they love them. The fit is right and the art is great, will definitely order again!",7
Coming from someone who buys screen printed shirts often.The quality of the t-shirt is very important.The work itself is great.But if you put that work on a so-so shirt it brings down the quality of everything.I would recommend getting a beefier Hanes T-shirt.,7

Responsive to questions that I had about my order in a timely manner.Great customer service and quality of t shirt and shipping time was great,7
The service was great. The arrival of the product was prompt (which was very much appreciated) and T-shirt is very good quality. I found it to be a little snugger than i had anticipated but that���������s more a matter of personal preference than an issue with the shirt itself. I would recommend this ,7
The quality of the tee shirt itself is the highest possible. The durability and quality of the graphics is excellent. Comparable tees on the market are usually a third to fifty percent more. I have become and will continue to be a repeat customer.,7
"The designs of the shirts are great, the quality is another story. One shirt is super clingy and the other shrunk like crazy.",7

"I ordered a ""SubGenius"" mug and Tee-shirt from Teepublic. Both items are of good quality. It would be nice if they offered a larger mug for us coffee fanatics or several sizes/styles to choose from. The shirt I ordered a larger size being 100% cotton but I still had to stretch it out to get it to fit. Then again I am not your average size human, I am on the large size and gravity challenged. Additionally I would like to customize or at least spell-out what I would like on the two items I ordered if possible. Not asking for much am I...",7

"Not the most robust print I've seen. The shirts were competently constructed. It took a bit for them to arrive. (I've made shirts myself, asdesigner. I wouldn't have probably approved the print if it was a project I was responsible for. Not the art, the quality of the print.)",7
"Was excited to find a design I like, however the colors on the actual shirt that arrived are not crisp, like the colors bled into each other, colors not true to original image.Shame, I really like the artists design.",7

"I was excited about my first opportunity to support some local and/or independent entrepreneurs. After a long delay with the tracking of my order, I was given a tracking number, which never updated. I was told that my order shifted to USPS from UPS, which made using the tracking number I was provided impossible.Once I opened up an online support chat to question why I couldn't track my order, I was informed that I was given the wrong tracking number, via email. I did receive all items ordered but instead of 6-10 business days, it took around 15. I wasn't happy with my experience and after I purge through my frustrations, I will most likely order again. Excluding the poor shipping process, I was quite pleased with my purchase. Thank you.",7
"I was sent the wrong order (and it was twice). I think I should be allowed to exchange items. I was sent Heavy Cotton instead of Organic, recycled cotton which was what I usually order. Also, from my perspective, tees were being advertised for $16.",7

I am a returning customer and i am very pleased with my purchased i would highly recommend this company.,7
The items took a while to get but I like the quality. One is a little blurry but I'm not sure if that's how it's how its supposed to be.,7
I would give your service 4 stars but the product zero stars. I am so disappointed. The phone cover does NOT fit!!! You sent me a replacement cover but it too does not fit! I followed your instructions to put the black band on first and then to press the cover onto the phone. It must require some kind of special tool to make the cover fit. I have 2 other phone covers that fit this phone just fine. I've thought about taking everything to a jeweler or similar place but I don't want this cover if it is such a hassle should I ever need to remove it and put it back on. I think there is a huge design flaw that the black band was not glued inside the case. But I wonder if even that would make it fit. Please refund my money. Thank you.,7
Great customer service and speedy delivery!,7
The prints wear out too fast. Delivery was good.,7
The shirt arrived in timely fashion and is comfy as hell.,7

I've created an account, invested the last two hours uploading my paintings and they closed my account for violation of terms, without any further clarification.My paintings were about plants, things like a ficus, figs and daisies. I do feel disrespectful from their part to entirely cancel an account without investing two lines of explanation. Another big company that feels the time of a single contributor doesn't matter at all. Sad, considering their tagline of supporting independent artists.",7
